Our task was to remove existing pipework and replace with new. This included pipework that travelled under culvert, as well as on top of water ways and along the wharf.\
Risk assessments were undertaken, and strategies put in place to ensure there were no environmental implications, including to fauna and reptile life.\
The project consisted of 2km of piping and prior to completion the system was pressure tested and back to full working order.
