## Overview

Trident Australia, established in 1998 and based in Perth, Western Australia, and Victoria, provides engineered solutions for critical fluid and pneumatic systems. With over 27 years of industry experience, we deliver end-to-end conceptual design, reverse engineering, manufacturing, assembly, and testing services for demanding and safety-critical environments.

Our core capabilities include the design and manufacture of custom pneumatic and fluid systems, hose assemblies, precision fabrication, and NATA-accredited calibration services. These capabilities are supported by a skilled in-house engineering team, advanced workshop facilities, and established ISO-certified quality management systems.

While Trident has a strong history supporting the oil & gas, subsea, mining, and industrial sectors, we have recently commenced our formal journey into the defence industry. Despite being new to the sector, we have already secured Defence purchase orders for hose integrity management and calibration services--demonstrating confidence in our technical capability, traceability, and compliance with Defence standards and expectations.

Trident is committed to supporting Australia's sovereign defence capability by strengthening local supply chains, investing in relevant defence certifications, and aligning our processes and documentation with industry requirements. Our local design and manufacturing capability enables rapid response, quality assurance, and reduced reliance on imported systems--supporting operational readiness and through-life sustainment.

As we continue to expand our defence footprint, Trident remains focused on building trusted, long-term partnerships with Defence Primes, SMEs, and end users. Through collaboration, innovation, and quality-driven outcomes, we aim to contribute meaningfully to Australia's defence industrial base and the success of future programs under AUKUS and beyond.
## Capabilities

Trident Australia provides design, engineering, manufacturing, and testing solutions for critical pneumatic and fluid systems. With over 27 years of experience across heavy industry, our capabilities are built around reliability, traceability, and compliance--key requirements for defence applications.

Our core competencies include:

- Design and manufacture of custom pneumatic and fluid systems
- Hose assemblies and testing, including DNV-certified and stainless-steel convoluted hoses
- Precision fabrication, assembly, and hydrostatic pressure testing
- NATA-accredited calibration services for pressure, temperature, torque, and flow instrumentation
- System integration, documentation, and certification to industry and defence standards
- Stainless steel and copper nickel pipe spool fabrication
- Trident maintains over $6 million in inventory and a hire fleet of more than 2,600 assets
- Field service technicians

All services are delivered from our Perth and Victorian facilities, equipped with advanced test benches, hose crimping and flushing equipment, and a dedicated calibration laboratory. Our quality management system is ISO 9001 certified, and we maintain full material traceability and documentation control across all projects.

Trident has already supported Defence through the supply of hose integrity management and calibration services under recent purchase orders. These projects have demonstrated our ability to meet Defence's requirements for quality, traceability, and responsiveness. We have also provided technical support and system design input for defence-related maintenance and sustainment programs in Western Australia.

With a skilled local workforce and vertically integrated manufacturing capability, Trident Australia provides a responsive and sovereign supply option for Defence and defence industry partners. Our focus is on reliability, compliance, and safety--ensuring that all systems and components perform as intended in mission-critical environments.
