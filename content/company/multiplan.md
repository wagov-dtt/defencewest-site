## Overview

Bringing design ideas to life since 1993.

At Multiplan we are more than just tech-savvy construction modelling experts. We are problem-solvers, innovators and value-adders. We are relationship-builders, collaborators and solution-seekers. Taking pride in everything we do comes naturally, underpinning our reputation as a trusted digital engineering partner. Our trademarked Multiplan logo is a symbol for our exceptional customer service.

Leading the delivery of construction modelling and structural steel detailing services in Australia - and beyond

We are based in Perth, Western Australia,

Over the years we have built a world-class team of tech-savvy construction modelling and steel detailing experts who ensure Multiplan can take on any project, no matter what the size or location.

We are a values-driven organisation, but our values are more than just words.
## Capabilities

Our aim at Multiplan is to be seen as the solution, stopping potential issues in their track, all while adding constructability insights, production intelligence and skilled resourcing along the way.

Our Direct Client Engagement (DCE(tm)) model is the next evolution of the project client - detailer relationship and, our Direct Fabricator Engagement (DFE(tm)) model has always been a traditional part of our industry.

Expertise

We're the all-important link between project teams, their builder, engineers, and architects, and the steel fabrication process, we translate ideas from engineering into fully-resolved digital construction models and millimetre-perfect shop drawings - right down to the last steel beam, plate and bolt.

Spotting issues before they arise is a key part of our role. We add innovation and value through early engagement and efficient scheduling. Our experienced, expert team has an unbeatable track record in finishing on time and on budget. We forge proactive, reliable project partnerships to deliver industry-leading solutions on mega projects.

Whether it is early engagement with designers or visualising construction from completed documentation, our modelling drives time and cost efficiencies, mitigates risk and delivers invaluable data and insights.

Working directly with engineering teams to produce detailed 3D construction models enables us to raise and address technical queries early on in the process, preventing costly downstream changes and delays, and ensuring a seamless transition to fabrication.

Our 3D digital models and skilled resourcing add constructability insights and production intelligence to every project we work on.

At Multiplan, agile project management has become part of our everyday, helping us work quickly and collaboratively, on budget and to deadline, as we translate ideas into the precision-perfect steel drawings fabricators rely on.

Feedback can be acted on quickly and responsive changes made so that projects proceed accurately and efficiently.

Seamless workflows, work packs and modules are designed to suit both workshop capacity and project schedules.

Integrated reporting follows the entire process, from material purchase through to assembly and erection.
