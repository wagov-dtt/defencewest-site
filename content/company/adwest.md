## Overview

Adwest Group is a fabrication company. We mainly deal in steel but are just as comfortable with stainless steel and aluminium. We also have an in-house sand blast and powdercoating facility.\
We have ISO9002 accreditation, and have worked on many major mining projects and for most blue chip mining companies in WA. We are used to MDRS and our welders/boilermakers are all qualified.
## Capabilities

We are capable of undertaking the supply, fabrication, powdercoating and fixing on signs, all to specified drawings provided by our customers. We have the agility to manufacture many small items and stay in total control of the process.
