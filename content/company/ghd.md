## Capabilities

Established in 1928 and privately owned by our people, GHD operates across five continents - Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America - and the Pacific region. We employ more than 8500 people in 200+ offices to deliver projects with high standards of safety, quality and ethics across the entire asset value chain. Driven by a customer-service led culture, we connect the knowledge, skill and experience of our people with innovative practices, technical capabilities and robust systems to create lasting community benefits. With one in every four of our people being a shareholder, GHD does not have any external ownership - the sustained growth, direction and success of our company is determined by the people who work at GHD. This allows us to plan for the long term, setting strategies that enable growth and develop some of the best technical capabilities in the world.
