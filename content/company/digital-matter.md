## Overview

Digital Matter is an innovative Australian technology company that designs and develops embedded electronic solutions along with software platforms required to manage and report asset activities and events.
Our achievements have been recognised via many awards. We deliver tracking devices to the tracking industry, along with devices in the 'Internet of Things' space that utilise LPWAN networks, such as: Sigfox, LoRa, CatM1 and NBIoT. Digital Matter is also a world leader in battery powered tracking devices.
## Capabilities

Over the last 16 years, Digital Matter has designed and commercialised products ranging from customer feedback devices to vehicle fleet management systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) telematics solutions in Agtech and Smart City solutions. Our skilled team of engineers and developers are able to take a product idea or specification and manage this through the process of concepts, electronics design,
Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design and layout, industrial design of housings and cases, firmware development, communications protocols, software development and mass product production. We refer to this series of activities as 'owning the whole Intellectual Property (IP) stack'. This provides uniqueness and differentiation in the marketplace: being able to design and develop with agility and experience to deliver quality products and solutions. Digital Matter also retains an ability to customise an enterprise's requirements.
