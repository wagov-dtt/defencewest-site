With an award-winning civil & structural design team engaged in diverse projects across the engineering spectrum, we embrace the individuality of each engineer, designer, client and project to ensure our service remains bespoke and nimble. **We are here to design better futures, differently.** This purpose and design philosophy supports our overall vision - to create engineered futures beyond convention. With offices in Perth and Melbourne, Peritas has a dedicated team of fifty professionals who provide constructible solutions, cutting-edge technologies, and reliable techniques to deliver integrated engineering solutions that minimise costs, risks and time-frames for clients.

We deliver robust and resilient engineering design solutions tailored for the demanding requirements of the Australian Defence Industry. At Peritas we ensure to deliver secure, efficient and cost effective design that meets the stringent standards of Defence projects.

  Over the years we have seen Austal Ships grow from a small group of dedicated shareholder employees into one of the best large aluminium fast vessel designers/constructors in the world.

With every expansion, we were involved both with the design and construction/management of their new facilities.

Cash strapped because of growth, Austal demanded and expected cost efficient large steel structures to manufacture a wide range of large aluminium catamarans and ferries.
