## Capabilities

NAUTIC Technologies is advancing underwater systems with its Smart Buoyancy Control Device (Smart BCD), currently at TRL 5, offering enhanced safety and efficiency for defence, commercial, and recreational applications.

The Smart BCD introduces innovative buoyancy management, ensuring precise and reliable underwater control. Its onboard monitoring system enhances diver safety by providing real-time adjustments and continuous support. This capability reduces risks during underwater operations and promotes greater confidence for users in challenging environments.

By automating buoyancy adjustments, the Smart BCD allows users to focus on their tasks without the need for constant manual intervention. This increases operational efficiency and reduces the physical and mental demands often associated with underwater activities.

In addition to its benefits for defence, the Smart BCD's adaptable and modular design opens opportunities for integration into commercial and recreational sectors, such as diving tourism and underwater exploration. This versatility makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of underwater endeavors.

NAUTIC Technologies is committed to developing innovative solutions that prioritise safety and enhance operational effectiveness. The Smart BCD is a significant step forward in creating tools that support users across multiple sectors, offering a blend of advanced technology and user-focused design.
