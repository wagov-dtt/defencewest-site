## Overview

Whittens is a family-owned Australian civil contracting company established in 2001, with a proven track record of delivering complex infrastructure projects across mining, oil & gas, and defence sectors. Over the past two decades, we have grown into one of Australia's largest specialist civil contractors, recognised nationally for our capability, reliability, and commitment to excellence.

Our involvement in the defence industry reflects our ability to operate in highly regulated environments where precision, safety, and security are paramount. We have successfully delivered civil and concrete works for major defence infrastructure projects, including bulk earthworks, detailed earthworks, and formwork, reinforcement, and concrete (FRP) packages. These projects often require strict compliance with defence standards, robust quality assurance processes, and seamless collaboration with multiple stakeholders - all areas where Whittens excels.

With an annual turnover exceeding $200M and a team of experienced professionals, we bring the scale, resources, and expertise needed to support Australia's defence capability. Our ingrained values of integrity, reliability, and accountability ensure that we consistently meet client expectations while maintaining the highest standards of safety and environmental performance.

Whittens is proud to contribute to projects that strengthen Australia's national security and defence infrastructure. Our focus remains on delivering quality outcomes, fostering strong partnerships, and supporting the long-term objectives of the defence sector.
