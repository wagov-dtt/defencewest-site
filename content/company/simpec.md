## Overview

Australian owned and operated, SIMPEC deliver specialised capabilities in Structural, Mechanical, and Piping (SMP), Electrical and Instrumentation (E&I), and Civil services. Since establishment, the company has built a strong reputation for delivering complex, high-value projects across a range of industries including mining, energy, and infrastructure.

SIMPEC offers a unique ability to self-perform and deliver fully integrated vertical projects valued up to and including A$100 million - taking designs from concept through construction, commissioning, and handover, while managing the full supply chain to ensure streamlined project delivery, cost efficiency, and minimal risk for our clients.

As a subsidiary of WestStar Industrial, SIMPEC has the capability to collaborate with associate company Alltype Engineering, to offer fully integrated fabrication solutions -- offering a seamless interface between fabrication and field execution, further strengthening and driving value for our clients.

SIMPEC's safety culture is fundamental to every aspect of its operations. The company's dedicated safety framework, **SIMSafe**, underpins all activities and is designed to drive positive safety outcomes while reducing the risk of harm to both people and the environment.
## Capabilities

With our comprehensive and highly specialised range of services across our three core disciplines -- **Structural, Mechanical and Piping (SMP), Electrical and Instrumentation (E&I),** and **Civil construction** -- SIMPEC is well-positioned to be a reliable contributor to the defence sector, particularly in **infrastructure and redevelopment projects.**

At the centre of our execution capability is a **highly skilled, directly employed workforce**. While the majority of our team is based in **Western Australia**, we deliver projects **nationally** and maintain a **second office in Sydney, New South Wales**. Our large facility in **Wattleup, WA**, operated by our in-house team, enables us to **mobilise and demobilise quickly**, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness for both metropolitan and remote projects.

Our people are supported by **mature project management systems and robust quality assurance processes** that ensure safe, consistent, and compliant delivery across all phases of construction. From early-stage construction planning through to commissioning and final handover, we have the **experience, systems, and workforce** in place to deliver **end-to-end project execution** across a wide range of project types and environments.
