## Overview

Thornton Tomasetti Pty Ltd is headquartered in Perth and has been working in the Energy sector in AUS for a decade and Defence sector for 4 years. Within both sectors we specialise in conducting advanced analysis of extreme loading events (shock, blast, fire, seismic, etc..) as well as testing which currently focuses on Defence. We operate our own naval shock test machine (JASSO) to qualify equipment for use on Defence platforms as well as operating the heavyweight shock barge on behalf of Defence at their underwater explosive test facility. We have extensive advanced analysis and software development capabilities which when combined with the testing enables us to provide a holistic service to clients, supporting them at any stage of the design and/or qualification process.

Thornton Tomasetti has built a team of highly experienced engineers and scientists across Australia with extensive experience directly supporting several ADF projects. Thornton Tomasetti will continue to build this expertise and provide specialist Naval platform survivability, Land platform survivability, Explosive Safety, Facility protection design, Engineering and testing services. The team consists of members who have decades of combined expertise working with DSTG and the RAN in high risk/high consequence areas as well as specialised expertise in T&E, advanced analysis (CFD/FEA) and software development.

In addition to our direct defence support capabilities, the Australian team also has significant experience supporting high risk industries, decarbonisation, safety and risk management, future fuels (including battery analysis) and Protective Design and Security (Security Risk assessments, Heavy Vehicle Mitigation and structural blast assessments).

In addition, Thornton Tomasetti is part of a global company, including with over 50 years experience supporting the US DoD and over 25 years supporting the UK MoD.
## Capabilities

We have a range of specialised capabilities to support Defence Industry including but not limited to:

- Shock testing of equipment (Recent examples include work for EM Solutions and Marenav to qualify their equipment)
- Design and analysis for extreme loads including: Shock, Blast, Fire, Seismic etc..(Recent examples include work for a Defence Prime on shock and DST Group on blast)
- Specialised T&E support in relation to other extreme loading events (GWEO, vibration, blast, ballistics)
- Safety and Risk Management (Recent example includes work for Defence on explosive safety software development including a risk assessment framework)
- World class advanced analysis utilising a number of CFD and FEA tools assessing a wide range of Defence problems (A recent example is work on thermal runaway for batteries and associated structural effects due to thermal effects.
## Discriminators

- Thornton Tomasetti is the only company in Australia that operates across the full spectrum of naval platform survivability - design, analysis and testing. We conduct this work across all AUKUS nations, advising navies, writing standards and supporting our clients in the unique environment of naval combatants.
- We have a unique set of skills that enable us to provide cradle to grave support to the design and qualification of equipment and structures against a variety of loading conditions, through testing and advanced analysis.
- Thornton Tomasetti is the only company, in Australia and globally, that operates shock machines specifically designed to conduct testing on live munitions. Our portable shock test machine 'JASSO' is currently used in Australia for testing equipment for the Royal Australian Navy, but could be used in support of current GWEO test and evaluation efforts.
- Actively working or recently worked with Australian Submarine Agency, Directorate Ordnance Safety, Navy Engineering, DST Group, Various Navy Projects, Range of Australian Defence Industry Primes and SMEs.
- DISP Accreditation and security cleared staff.
