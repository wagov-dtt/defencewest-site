## Overview

NW Futures Group commenced business in mid 2022, with the vision to repurpose our proven model to create infrastructure partnerships with existing public and private companies and State and Commonwealth land holders under existing legislation. We are independent and believe in multiuser facilities that blend into existing supply chains and improve the rapid deployment of security measures in the strategic area of the northwest.

Our partners that are tier 1 energy companies and Australian and defence companies, are committed to combining subsea and coastal hubs. for the mutual benefit of private, public and security stakeholders.

By sharing resources and repurposing used materials and equipment, the oil and gas and resource industry and defence can reduce their overall environmental impact and increase their efficiency. This circular supply chain approach could also lead to cost savings for both industries, as they would be able to reduce their dependence on new materials and equipment. Overall, a circular supply chain between the oil and gas, resource industry and defence can improve sustainability, increase efficiency, and reduce waste.
## Capabilities

NW futures We know how to co-exist Petroleum licences, mining tenements with what we call "mapping" - how leases can co-exist together and protects existing and future rights.

We were delighted our submission to the 2023 Defence Strategic Review was included and the opportunity to repurpose and transform Oil and Gas facilities and subsea assets.

Ultimately, sharing oil and gas assets with defence is a complex issue that requires balancing national security needs with the economic interests of the oil and gas industry. Governments carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of such cooperation to ensure that it aligns with their strategic objectives and serves the broader interests of their citizens. We are also working with AUKUS partners to invest into WA for establishing test hubs located within the North West Shelf.
