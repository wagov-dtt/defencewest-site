## Overview

Bid Write Pty Ltd (BidWrite) provides a range of tender and proposal management services to companies seeking to improve win rates for contestable business within Defence. Services include capture and bid strategy development, bid writing support, bid process enhancement and training, both public and in-company.

Our Australian team is backed up by an international peer consulting network encompassing professionals located in eight countries.
## Capabilities

BidWrite helps organisations win and retain business through contestable/competitive sourcing processes and is one of very few businesses in Australia offering this singular focus. The BidWrite difference is characterised by a 360 degree perspective, alignment to global best practice industry bodies and a defined methodology known as 'The BidWrite Way'. Our decades of procurement and bid response experience allow us to combine buyer and seller side insights, resulting in better procurement outcomes overall. Our delivery model relies on permanent staff rather than contractors. This providing continuity, a team-based approach and ongoing familiarity with client offerings and operating models. With 1/3 of our staff holding former Defence careers, we understand the industry. With a track record of over 2000 tender submissions for SMEs, NFPs, Defence Primes and other Tier 1 listed contractors across Australia, our experience spans helping bidders successfully compete for Australia's largest Defence platform tenders and Defence infrastructure redevelopment opportunities, right through to helping lower tier contractors break into Defence supply chains.
