The locally owned company is highly recognised across major industrial sectors for its proven quality and reliability and is compatible with defense industry Primes. The industrial complex incorporates an all-inclusive range of machining centers with few limitations to size or capacity. Fabrication and welding facilities are comprehensively furnished with repetitive welding works via fully autonomous robot units. Fitting facilities are significant, servicing gearboxes and a range of other industrial equipment. Fitting facilities provide an opportunity for OEM complete assembly from new manufacture, refurbishment or maintenance of equipment. Supplementary services include engineering design, drafting, blast, paint and hot cast polyurethane.
## Capabilities

Continuous delivery in full on time (DIFOT) of quality-built components/equipment to industries most demanding clients has honed a level of professionalism across the entire operation and its staff. Camco HSEQ management systems now exceed the standard ISO accreditation requirement. Compliance to the most stringent audits can be achieved. The company provides a unique internal ability to manage the works in full with limited external support. This ensures company commitments to our clients are continuously met. The capacity to provide sustainment support to our clients in the workshop or field with technical staff ensures a compatible workable relationship.
