## Overview

Lalli Consulting Engineers have proudly supported Australia's Defence sector for over a decade, delivering structural engineering and asset inspection services tailored to the unique demands of the sector. With a strong foundation in structural design, we have been trusted in designing and inspecting a range of Defence assets from general building to bespoke and specialized structures and facilities across Western Australia.

Our involvement in the Defence industry began over 10 years ago, focusing on the structural design of critical assets. Since then, we have expanded our capabilities to include the design and documentation of new structures, upgrades to existing facilities, and the provision of reactive and proactive inspections and engineering support. Our work spans a range of Defence environments, including training facilities, operational bases, and support infrastructure.

Our approach combines technical proficiency with a deep understanding of the end user's requirements and the need for resilient, fit for purpose and long-term solutions.

Our team's experience in asset condition audits, structural remediation, and design innovation positions us to support Defence West's mission of strengthening Western Australia's Defence capability.
