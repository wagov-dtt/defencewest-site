## Overview

Doric Contractors is privately owned and has operated since 1989. Our primary capabilities are in construction, project management, design management, cost estimation, programming, time and cost scheduling and building.
Over the past three decades Doric Contractors has grown to become one of Western Australia's largest and most reputable privately-owned construction companies. We have earned a reputation for being solutions-based, collaborative and reliable; and for delivering landmark buildings and infrastructure to the highest quality and safety standards.
## Capabilities

We have won an excellence medal and gold award at the Australian Business Excellence Awards, which demonstrates that the quality of our leadership, management practices, business systems and people is of the highest standard, and comparable to that achieved by many of the world's leading and most respected organisations.
On behalf of the Commonwealth Government, the Department of Defence has engaged Doric as its Managing Contractor to plan, design and construct the HMAS Stirling Redevelopment Stage 3A project.
