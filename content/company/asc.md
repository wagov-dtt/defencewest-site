## Overview

ASC is owned by the Commonwealth of Australia, and exists to serve the frontline of Australia’s naval defence capabilities. Initially established in 1985 as the prime contractor for the design, manufacture and delivery of six Collins-class submarines, we were awarded in 2005 a build contract for three Hobart-class air warfare destroyers. With more than 2,500 employees across three facilities in WA and South Australia, ASC has evolved into the nation’s largest specialised defence shipbuilding organisation

## Capabilities

In WA, ASC maintains its own facilities adjacent to the Common User Facility at Henderson to support the Collins-class submarine fleet. In 2003 we commenced a 25-year contract to undertake the ongoing repair, maintenance and design upgrades of the submarines. This through-life support contract was replaced by the current In-Service Support Contract (ISSC) in mid-2012. ASC maintains a highly-skilled workforce in the West that currently undertakes up to mid-cycle dockings for submarines in WA
