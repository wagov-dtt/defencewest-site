## Overview

Aurora Labs Limited (Aurora) is a developer of metal 3D printing, or Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology based in Perth, Western Australia. The Company was founded in 2014, listed in 2016 on the ASX, and since then has progressed its core suite of 3D printing technologies, specialising in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) printing of metals. Aurora also offers printing and associated research project services to local clients and industry partners. Aurora's technology significantly lowers the cost of printing, to a point at which it becomes cost effective to utilise for many of the industrial applications that have used a combination of casting, forging and subtractive forms of manufacturing.
## Capabilities

Aurora Labs' multi-discipline engineering team can design, modify and 3D print both new and legacy parts. We offer an end-to-end solution from inventory assessment, 3D scanning, design and optimization for duty, to production and deployment. Using both our proprietary in-house metal 3D printers and our third-party plastic machines, we are able to offer short-run and serial 3D printing in metals as well as in a wide range of polymers.
