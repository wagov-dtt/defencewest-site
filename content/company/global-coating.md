## Overview

Global Coating Systems (GCS) is an Australian-owned SME specialising in the design, development, and application of advanced protective coatings for the defence, maritime, and critical infrastructure sectors. Founded on decades of experience in delivering high-performance coating solutions for heavy industry, GCS has strategically expanded its capabilities to meet the unique demands of the defence industry, focusing on increased survivability, through-life asset performance, and operational readiness.

Our proven technologies - BattleJacket(r) , FireCap(tm), BlastBack, and WarCoat - provide protection against ballistic threats, fire, blast, corrosion, and extreme environmental exposure. These coatings are engineered for mission-critical applications, from armoured vehicles and naval platforms to defence infrastructure and logistics assets.

Underpinning our offering is a strong research and development program, which is advancing next-generation solutions in anti-biofouling coatings, frequency shielding materials, and other specialised defence-grade surface technologies. This innovation is supported by collaborations with research organisations, industry partners, and end users, ensuring our products are tailored to operational needs and evolving threat environments.

With manufacturing based in Australia, GCS provides sovereign capability, rapid turnaround, and strict compliance with defence standards. Our team has a proven track record in safely delivering complex projects in remote, hazardous, and time-critical conditions, capabilities directly transferable to defence sustainment, upgrade, and deployment requirements.

By combining industrial-scale coating expertise with targeted defence R&D, GCS delivers solutions that extend asset life, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance operational resilience. Our mission is to ensure that Australia's defence and maritime forces are equipped with cutting-edge surface protection systems that perform when it matters most.
## Capabilities

Global Coating Systems (GCS) delivers advanced protective coatings engineered to enhance survivability, asset longevity, and operational readiness across defence platforms and infrastructure. Our technologies protect against ballistic threats, blast, fire, corrosion, biofouling, and environmental degradation, delivering through-life cost savings and performance gains.

We tailor coatings to meet the weight, space, and operational constraints of individual defence platforms. For land vehicles, maritime assets, or fixed infrastructure, our engineering teams ensure seamless integration without compromising performance or mobility.

GCS utilises advanced laboratories capable of simulating operational environments to test effectiveness, adhesion, durability, and thickness. This enables rapid iteration and validation to meet strict defence specifications, with R&D tailored to specific threat profiles and mission needs.

While our defence portfolio is emerging, we have demonstrated potential to key stakeholders. The 13th Light Horse Brigade field-tested our BattleJacket(r) system, confirming its lightweight, scalable ballistic protection for deployed assets. This trial showcased our responsiveness, technical agility, and end-user focus.

Alongside BattleJacket(r), our range includes FireCap(tm), BlastBack, WarCoat, and next-generation solutions such as anti-biofouling and frequency-shielding coatings. These capabilities position GCS as a sovereign Australian supplier of advanced coating systems for the most demanding environments.

Our mission is to provide defence with adaptable, tested surface protection solutions that keep assets in service longer, perform better, and enhance personnel safety.
