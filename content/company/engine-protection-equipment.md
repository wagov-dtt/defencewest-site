## Overview

WA family owned and operated business established 50 years. Heavily involved in the mining, marine and commercial transport industries. Situated a 10 minute drive from the AMC at Henderson, we are well placed to support the shipbuilding and repair industries with custom exhausts, tube fabrication, filtration, instrumentation, Vibration Isolation, Thermal insulation and gasket manufacturing.

## Capabilities

We can supply off the shelf filtration, Instrumentation, Vibration Isolation products to support engines and equipment on any Vessel or piece of machinery/equipment using an internal combustion engine. We can custom manufacture bespoke exhaust systems and also provide thermal insulation. Our workshop can also provide custom tube work in Stainless, Aluminium and mild steel. We have yet to break into the defense industry in a major way, only minor jobs. However, we have provided exhaust and cooling packages for 16 brand new Rolls Royce Bergen engines which run the Solomon mine power station in WA
