## Overview

Operating now for over 30 years, Pedco Engineering provides metal forming and fabrication/welding services for mild, stainless, exotic steels and alloys. We specialise in mild to heavy steel plate, including impact-resistant steels. We retain an in-house drafting capability and provide full material traceability on all supplied works. Pedco is ISO9001 certified and to date has primarily serviced the mining, oil and gas, defence and agricultural sectors.
## Capabilities

We are a demonstrated research and development organisation. As a multiple recipient of research and development Tax Incentives and Industry Facilitation and Support Program (IFSP) grants, our company functions as a project shop which prides itself on our ability to solve problems in a timely and cost-effective manner. Not only do we design and produce works in-house, but we also provide import replacement services for some global organisations.
