## Overview

International Maritime Services (IMS) is an Australian award-winning SME ship delivery and crewing specialist providing qualified and experienced test and trials crew for patrol boats, large high-speed ferries and commercial inshore and offshore vessels. Since 1985, IMS has provided global ship delivery and manning solutions. On-keel ship delivery, management and crew training are the services on which our reputation has been forged.

We have a proud, successful history and a demonstrated ability to trial and deliver any vessel to and from any port across the globe while providing a complete technical management and crew training service.
## Capabilities

Since 2001, IMS has provided crews for over 100 Defence and government vessels built in Australia and the USA. These include the Austal-built Armidale, Cape and Guardian class patrol boat programs; the Damen built Damen EGS Besant RGS Stoker, and several Austal USA-built Expeditionary Fast Transport for the US Navy. Swift, clear and concise communications are an essential element in harbour and sea acceptance trials program for a new vessel. The ship-handling experts at IMS act as that conduit; providing the shipyard and Defence representatives vital information. This includes how the vessel is responding while being cognisant of the specified scope and requirements of any specific sea trial.

Our proven capability and flexibility in crewing first of class ships during sea trials has proven invaluable to shipyards who have the opportunity to fine-tune the trials program for follow-on vessels. No other Australian company can boast the track record IMS has with Defence vessel crew familiarisation training. IMS has prepared vessel-specific training material and continues to deliver that training to Australian and international crews operating over 90 patrol vessels around the world. From 21m monohulls to 72m high-speed catamarans, IMS delivers. Our impressive list includes the Bay and Cape class patrol boats, the Armidale class patrol boat fleet and continues today as IMS delivers training to Pacific Islands crews for the 21 Guardian class patrol boats.
