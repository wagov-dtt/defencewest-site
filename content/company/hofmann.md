## Overview

Hofmann Engineering is a globally recognised engineering solutions provider to the defence industry, and offers a range of specialised tooling capability to support the manufacture of major components and
sub-assemblies for Air Force, Army and Navy Assets. Our full turn-key tooling service incorporates: engineering design; manufacture; fabrication; assembly; accredited testing and installation; electro/mechanical site service; and MRO and through life support capabilities.
## Capabilities

Since 1969, we have provided specialist engineering services to Australia's defence and industry sectors. Our technology development program has been driven by commercially demanding customers whose owners and shareholders demand return
on investment, and therefore regard lost time as lost revenue. Reputation and survival is accordingly achieved by the rapid application of effort with technology, innovation and risk management.
Hofmann Engineering considers a daily tenacity must be maintained in operations that mirrors, and even exceeds, end-user requirements and expectations.
This is our key focus. The optimum mix for defence is the teamed combination of this culture - from the civil-commercial industry with the understanding of defence requirements - gained from our close relationships with the military and the major primes.
