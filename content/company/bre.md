## Overview

BRE Engineering commenced operations in Western Australia in 2016 and set out to create solutions for engineering problems where others could not, whilst creating an atmosphere for engineers to learn and see a project through from concept to finished product. During this time we have successfully delivered projects to multiple primes on new builds acting as an OEM and engineering support as well as supporting existing builds through maintenance and sustainment.

## Capabilities

BRE Engineering is a nimble, forward thinking engineering business. Our point of difference stems from our team of well-rounded engineers who produce innovative, cost effective solutions and designs that exceed relevant standards and performance criteria. We believe that engineers should design, verify and test their work to ensure that it is fit for purpose and works as intended. This approach yields faster and more consistent results time and time again. We support projects across the defence industry from concept through design, manufacturing and installation, providing service support and sustainment for life of product. In doing so our vision is to be universally recognised as a trusted provider and partner of enduring solutions for an evolving defence market.
