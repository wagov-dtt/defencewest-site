Halo Civil Engineering commenced operations in Western Australia in 2021 with a resolute vision: to become the preeminent choice of contractor for complex civil and construction projects for quality clients such as the Australian Defence Force and it's suppliers.

Since our inception, we have consistently demonstrated our capability by successfully completing projects for Federal, State, and private clients, spanning metropolitan, remote, and regional areas.

We specialise in providing comprehensive multidisciplinary civil services tailored specifically for government and private agencies such as the defence sector.

At Halo our mission is to have exceptional people deliver successful projects while causing zero harm. Our ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on our clients, our industry and the community we proudly serve.

We have a thorough understanding of the Department of Defence's compliance requirement and security protocols and the capability to construct, upgrade and maintain defence infrastructure.
