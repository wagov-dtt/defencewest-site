## Overview

Fremantle Steel Fabrication is part of the Fremantle Steel Group, which includes Park Engineers and combined has over 100 years of experience in fabricating structural steel components. The Group has the capability to manufacture, pre-assemble and deliver 40,000 tonnes of product per annum through facilities that comprise 36,000 square metres of undercover workshops and 60,000 square metres of laydown area.
## Capabilities

We offer the latest technology in advanced manufacturing processes and project controls. Our beam manufacturing facility has unique capacities, including the ability to produce beams with a web depth up to 4 metres in height, and lengths of up to 30 metres across all major steel grades. Our Computer Numeric Control (CNC) laser pipe and tube processing line can cut with extremely high precision - up to 610 millimeters diameter pipe and 500 millimeters square tube. Project control competencies include the development of a 4D capability by combining our 3D Navisworks and Primavera P6 programs for project progress analysis. Having the ability to see a sequence of events depicted on a timeline enables us to quickly determine the required optimal solution with regard to effectively utilising labour, materials and time variables across a project.
