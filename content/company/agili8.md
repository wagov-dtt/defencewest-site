## Overview

Agili8 was founded in adversity to solve problems of time, logistics and gaps to save lives, protect assets and transform operations.

Our patented XRAI Vision high speed edge computing incorporates 3-in-1 deep technologies of XR, AI and computer vision into a pair of light weight smartglasses for hands-free mission critical work.

This patented deep tech revolutionises how humans see, learn and work in the metaverse, enabling offsite experts' hands and tools to be teleported in real time to assist frontline workforce with live troubleshooting, improved situational awareness, rapid upskilling and real-time decision making.

Agili8 is a research partner for Defence Science and Technology Group, with multiple awards in innovation, XR, AI, cyber security and global impact awards, recognised as Australia's Most Innovative company. Our innovations have been showcased nationally at Land Forces and on Channel 9 Innovation Nation TV.

We also won multiple Commonwealth and State awards and grants in Defence and Health research to enhance Defence capabilities and was one of 12 companies representing WA Critical Technologies to US Defence.
