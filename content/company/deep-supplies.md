## Overview

Reacting to the problems we have seen over the past 25 years in the defence, maritime and oil and gas industries; Deep Supplies realised that there is an intelligent way of collecting all types of data. Having a team of qualified and very experienced operators; we have built our business on the ethic of providing reliable information first time.

## Capabilities

Deep Supplies brings the latest technically advanced system to Australia and New Zealand. Our American/ European approved systems with modular components can collect a wide variety of data; either below the sea, on the surface and up to 5000m above sea level. With a range of sensors collecting acoustic data, photogrammetry images, live personnel monitoring and/or a live video feedback to command centres. Our products can save lives and time. Most systems are deployed in under 5 minutes and can have up to 12 hours standby times. Our systems can be used not only for defence situations, but for detection of invasive marine species, search and rescue, surveillance, maritime support, reconnaissance, special operations, subsea/aerial drug concealments, poaching, bush fire monitoring and marine movement. If we do not have the system, we can build a system that can.
