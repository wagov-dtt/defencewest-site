Our company consistently delivers strong solutions across a broad range of fields. We are the proud recipient of an Australian Design Award (2006), along with JEC composites nominations in 2004 and 2010. Our point of difference is that we are Perth's most advanced composites manufacturer with abilities to work with all types companies and government bodies with big ideas in order to create what others cannot, or think cannot be done. We are not a risk-averse organisation and have a strong track record of undertaking difficult and complex projects and delivering positive results. Our facility is state-of-the-art while our composite processing plant and equipment is all located under one roof.
