## Overview

Protective Cases is a solutions-based company that since 1990 have offered a wide variety of case-based technical packaging products and services. We carry out in-house design and the manufacture of cases and foam inserts, and also prototype to large scale production.
## Capabilities

Society is increasingly mobilising its technical functions and solutions, which means that sensitive equipment needs to be transported into harsher environments with greater accountability. We are very responsive to these changes in customer requirements and have developed the systems, networks and 28 years of experience to satisfy this growing demand.
