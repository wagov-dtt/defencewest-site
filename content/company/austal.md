## Overview

Austal commenced operations in Henderson in 1988, with a vision to build high quality commercial vessels for the international market. Since then, we have produced over 260 commercial and defence vessels for over 100 customers in 50 countries, and have established additional ship building facilities in the USA and the Philippines. Austal is 'The Australian Shipbuilder': a defence prime contractor and maritime technology partner of choice; designing, constructing and supporting revolutionary defence and commercial vessels for the world's leading operators. Our mission is to provide a total product and service solution as a high performing, commercially disciplined prime contractor for the design, build and sustainment of defence ships and systems.

## Capabilities

Austal Australia aims to be recognised internally and externally as a high performing, commercially disciplined prime contractor of ships, systems and support - through the continuous and sustainable achievement of key business outcomes, namely: inspired people; innovative, high quality products and services; customer satisfaction; productivity and efficiency; and sound financial management. As a strategic business unit of the Austal Group and key partner within Austal's global network of shipyards and service centres, Austal Australia provides vessel design, construction and support services from its ship building facilities in Henderson, and service centres in Darwin (Northern Territory) and Cairns (Queensland). We also have a business development office in Australia's national capital, Canberra. Proudly designing and building some of the world's most iconic ships (including the world's largest and fastest trimaran passenger ferry), Austal Australia has been the centre of defence and commercial vessel design and innovation for the Austal Group and is an established and highly respected provider of sustainment services, globally. We have also developed, and continue to design, install, integrate and maintain sophisticated vessel information management systems (eg: MarineLink and IMARCS), communications and radar systems and advanced ride control systems (eg: RideControl).
