## Overview

VEEM produces gyrostabilisers, shaft lines and propellers and provides bespoke manufactured product services to the marine and defence industries, beginning with defence contracts in the late-1980s
for the Collins-class submarine program. Today our operation covers some 10,500 square metres and comprises Australia's largest non-ferrous foundry, Computer Numeric Control (CNC) machine shops, fitting shops, pattern shops, welding shops and design and administration offices. VEEM are also major exporters, including to Austal Ships for its US Navy warship program.
## Capabilities

VEEM's purpose-built Canning Vale based workshops are state-of-the-art and cover approximately 10,500 square metres. They have 10 - 25 tonne capacity cranes throughout. The company's plant and equipment is modern and heavily utilizes CNC and robotic technology.
Recognizing the growing global market demand for high performance, marine propellers, VEEM invested in adding to its propeller manufacturing capability with a focus on generating superb designs, ground breaking technology and associated patents, plus the most advanced CNC machinery and robotics in the world in order to achieve the necessary accuracies.

Building upon these core strengths, VEEM now also manufactures powerful gyrostabilisers for super yachts, patrol boats and offshore working vessels.
