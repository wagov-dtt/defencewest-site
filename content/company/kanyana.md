Kanyana Engineering stands out as a unique and prominent player in the WA defence industry due to our long-standing commitment to innovative and advanced manufacturing practices. With a rich history spanning over 25 years, we have successfully catered to various sectors, including commercial, industrial, mining, and defence. Kanyana's cutting-edge fiber laser cutting technology, enabling us to achieve remarkable tolerances of 0.03mm cutting sheet sizes 6000mm x 2500mm. This expanded cutting capability has propelled us into the realms of aerospace and shipbuilding manufacturing, where precision components and accuracy are of utmost importance.

We have already established a strong presence with Primes by supplying a range of critical parts. Our contributions to the Defence Industry (DI) include manufacturing rocket launcher trolleys, military drone fuel tanks, door brackets, and mountings for flags on ships. Moreover, our close collaboration with several DI contractors has resulted in successful partnerships. For Austal projects, we have assisted in ship kitchen fit-outs, storage lockers, and bracketry, providing overflow works for naval assets along with the production of maritime bracketry and legacy parts. At HMAS Stirling, we have supplied rocket launcher trolleys and fabricated stainless-steel drainage down-pipes on the naval base. Additionally, we have worked with Innovaero to supply drone aluminium parts and large aircraft floor structures.

In addition to our cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities and proven track record in the defence industry, Kanyana sets itself apart by implementing comprehensive Industry 4.0 documentation and tracking systems throughout the entire manufacturing process. We recognise the importance of data-driven operations and have embraced the principles of Industry 4.0 to enhance efficiency, productivity, and quality control.

These diverse engagements demonstrate our versatility and capability to deliver high-quality products across different defence projects. Kanyana Engineering's dedication to excellence, coupled with our ability to adapt and meet stringent industry standards, positions us as a trusted partner within the WA defence industry.
