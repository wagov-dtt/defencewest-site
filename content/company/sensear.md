## Overview

Sensear Pty Ltd is a global leader in developing and manufacturing best-in-class digital over-the-ear and in-the-ear industrial and military communication headsets for use with two-way radios and Bluetooth devices. Sensear's patented SENS technology simultaneously enhances speech and suppresses background noise so that users can verbally communicate, protect their hearing, and still maintain 360-degree awareness of their surroundings in noisy environments such as oil and gas, mining, construction, heavy manufacturing and other industrial work places.
## Capabilities

Sensear's design, development, manufacturing, and service facility located in Perth, Western Australia, has been at the fore-front of innovation since 2006. From the outset Sensear's objective was very simple: to enable people working in high noise environments to talk without having to remove their headphones or earplugs. Today, Sensear's range of over-the-ear and in-ear products use SENS(r), the same core patented technology as used in its very first product 15 years ago. SENS(r) (Speech Enhancement, Noise Suppression) technology combines multiple highly directive microphones and unique software algorithms to enhance speech whilst suppressing harmful ambient noise. As a global exporter of Hearing Protection Communication Headsets, Sensear mandatorily complies with the highest standards of conformity set by internationally recognised testing, certification, and research companies.
