## Overview

Greenroom Robotics is an Australian deep-tech company pioneering advanced maritime autonomy software. Since 2018, Greenroom has supported defence and national security outcomes by providing maritime control systems, AI/ML-enabled situational awareness, and digital infrastructure for autonomous and uncrewed surface vessels (USVs).

Our flagship product, GAMA, enables COLREGS-compliant autonomous navigation across diverse vessel types, while Lookout+ enhances detection and classification of surface threats using real-time vision-based perception. These systems have been deployed in support of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and other international naval clients through operational sea trials, research collaborations, and commercial demonstrations.

Greenroom operates at the intersection of software, autonomy, and naval innovation--delivering sovereign capabilities that enhance warfighter safety, reduce crew burden, and modernise fleet operations. As a trusted dual-use supplier, Greenroom is actively engaged in AUKUS Pillar II, contributing to allied innovation in unmanned maritime systems.
## Capabilities

Greenroom delivers software-first maritime autonomy solutions designed to be modular, scalable, and platform-agnostic. Our capabilities include:

- **Autonomous Navigation (GAMA):** Real-time COLREGS-aware navigational autonomy including route planning, sensor fusion, and mission control.
- **Perception & Threat Detection (Lookout+):** AI/ML-based detection from EO/IR cameras for object classification, geolocation, and target tracking.
- **Digital Simulation (MISSIM):** Synthetic environments for autonomy testing, AI model training, and hardware-in-the-loop validation.
- **Fleet & Mission Orchestration (MarOps):** Secure automated logging tools mission execution and reporting across distributed fleets.

Recent examples:

- **RAN PBAT Trials (2023-2024):** Greenroom systems were deployed aboard a large patrol vessel, enabling remote operations and threat detection in live sea environments.
- **UK & US Deployments:** Autonomous retrofits on commercial and defence-relevant platforms have demonstrated export readiness and interoperability.
- **DSTG Collaboration:** Provided autonomy software for experimentation and warfighter concept development in naval testbeds.

These capabilities allow defence stakeholders to deploy and experiment with trusted autonomy at low risk and low cost.
## Discriminators

- **Sovereign Software:** 100% Australian-owned and developed. No ITAR restrictions (AUKUS user - ITAR Exemption)
- **Software-First Autonomy:** Hardware-agnostic stack deployable on new builds and retrofits.
- **Proven at Sea:** Successfully trialled by the Royal Australian Navy under operational conditions.
- **Dual-Use, Scalable Design:** Deployable across defence, offshore, and transport sectors.
- **Sensor Fusion & Perception:** Real-time AI-enabled vision for enhanced threat awareness.
- **Trusted Partnerships:** Collaboration with DSTG, Austal Australia, EGS Survey, and international defence industry.
- **Recognised Innovation:** Finalist in multiple national innovation awards for dual-use tech.
- **Clearances & Accreditation:** DISP Member (Entry Level), ISO-compliant software processes.
