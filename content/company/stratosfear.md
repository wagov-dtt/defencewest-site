## Overview

Stratosfear is a fully-integrated finance, strategic management and corporate advisory firm, established in 2008 and purpose-built to support companies facing rapid scale, complex structure and growth demands. We specialise in delivering resilient, growth-ready organisations by blending capital advisory, strategic management and operational execution into one end-to-end service offering.

We have deep experience in high-growth sectors such as surf-wear and mining services (where year-on-year growth frequently exceeded 50 %) and bring that same intensity of financial rigour and strategic clarity to clients. Stratosfear's world-class capabilities in working-capital and capital-structure analysis - combined with our established networks in Western Australia and interstate - mean we're uniquely positioned to support defence-oriented enterprises.

Many defence suppliers face customer-concentration risk, stringent compliance regimes, heightened ESG expectations and limited access to tailored capital. We've worked with businesses in the defence sector previously in roles including capital-structure optimisation, working-capital improvement and strategic planning.

At Stratosfear we work in two modes: "guide" - instructing and empowering management teams - or "drive & do" - hands-on execution. Our approach is designed to augment and strengthen executive teams that may be stretched beyond their current operational, financial or strategic capacity.

Our goal is simple: to help create strong, stable, scalable enterprises that are positioned for long-term success in the defence ecosystem. We welcome the opportunity to support WA and national defence industry businesses in navigating growth, complexity and competitive advantage.
## Capabilities

We understand the distinctive challenges facing the WA defence industry -- long contracting cycles, demanding compliance and governance standards, and the need to balance capital intensity with agility. Stratosfear's integrated service model combines deep financial acumen with strategic and operational execution capability to ensure our clients are investment-ready, audit-compliant and commercially competitive.

**Core Competencies:**

- **Corporate Finance & Capital Advisory:** We design and negotiate capital structures optimised for working-capital efficiency, debt and equity stability, and sustainable funding -- critical for defence suppliers scaling to meet Commonwealth and Tier 1 contractor requirements.
- **Strategic Management & Planning:** Our diagnostics, growth strategies and market analysis position WA defence businesses to diversify contracts, strengthen governance and align operations to Defence procurement expectations.
- **Financial Performance & Managerial Accounting:** Through three-way forecasting, job-costing, and breakeven analysis, we improve margin control and project delivery certainty across engineering, logistics and technology programs.
- **Transactional & Advisory Expertise:** We guide M&A, divestment and investment decisions that expand capability, secure partnerships and attract aligned investors.
- **Operational Leadership & Governance:** We embed systems for accountability, compliance, and transformation leadership -- vital in regulated defence environments.

Our prior work with a WA-based defence engineering firm demonstrates our impact: restructuring financial operations, optimising cash flow and enabling the business to secure new Department of Defence contract extensions.

Stratosfear builds the financial and strategic foundations that enable Western Australia's defence industry to scale with strength and precision.
