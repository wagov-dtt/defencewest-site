## Overview

Ghost Fire Systems is a veteran owned and operated research and development company, focused on developing battlefield simulators. Ghost Fire Systems simulators integrate with in-service weapons and replicate them being fired, using electronics as a substitution for blank firing cartridges or explosive munitions. The simulators enable soldiers to train more often, enhancing their neural pathways, allowing them to process more information on the battlefield to improve their decision making and thus survivability.
## Capabilities

Ghost Fire Systems creates solutions to enhance training at the tactical team level. We design simulators to enable the warfighter to simulate any weapon system that they would have access to, on the ground, in the team tactical setting.

Our latest product, the Blank Firing Simulator, is being trialled with RAAF 2 Security Forces
