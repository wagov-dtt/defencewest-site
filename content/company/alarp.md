## Overview

ALARP Solutions is a specialist Risk and Safety Management consultancy committed to supporting private and government organisations in developing credible robust and complex Safety, Risk and Assurance Cases, and the development of supporting analysis artefacts. In addition, we also have extensive experience in the development of broader Governance, Risk, Assurance, Measurement, and Safety Management frameworks that improve business outcomes and support demonstrating compliance with legislation and adopted standards. We also provide training and mentoring in these key areas such that organisations can expand their understanding of system safety engineering techniques, Safety Management Systems, as well as Governance, Risk, Assurance, and Measurement principles.

Established in 2011 we are a wholly owned Australian business with offices and footprints in Perth, Adelaide and Canberra. Our consultants have extensive experience in the Air, Land and Maritime (Sub-sea and Surface) sectors covering a wide range of disciplines within those sectors, including navigation, communications, weapons and propulsion (Diesel, Gas and Nuclear).

*System and Safety Engineering Services* - Including Safety Analysis, Safety Compliance, Functional Safety assessments, Safety visualisation techniques (Fault Tree, Event Tree and Bow Tie methodologies), Systems Engineering and Safety Management (Policy, Governance, Assurance and Planning).

*Corporate Governance, Risk and Assurance* - Including organisational design, optimisation and assurance modelling, Change Management, operating design and Quality Management.
