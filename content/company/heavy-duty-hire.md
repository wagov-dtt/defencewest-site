## Overview

Our company has been working on defence bases in WA for around 12 months as a sub contractor. We have completed earthworks projects at Bindoon Training Facility, Garden Island and Pearce Airbase. We provide both equipment, operators and a project management that keeps projects safe, efficient and compliant.

## Capabilities

Earthmoving equipment hire - Excavators, Front End Loaders, Tipper trucks (Rigid and Articulating),
Transportable accommodation hire (delivery, servicing, refilling) - Site offices, Lunch rooms, toilets, generators, water tanks, secure fuel storage.
Operator capability - With our competent operators, we can help deliver projects safely, efficiently and on time.

## Discriminators

At HDH, we’ve built our business around solving the problems that cost clients time, money, and peace of mind:

  * Direct accountability – led by the Director, not a call centre, for fast decisions and personal responsibility.
  * Outcome focused - we know that repeat business is the best type, so we always seek to deliver the best possible outcome for our clients.
  * Turnkey site compounds – we'll deliver and commission our accommodation and power generation equipment ready to work
  * Smarter logistics – bunching assets together for transport, reducing wait times and costs
