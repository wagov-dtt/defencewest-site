## Overview

Established in 1993, CADDS Group is a Western Australian multidisciplinary organisation delivering integrated engineering, design, surveying, sustainability, digital, and fabrication services across industrial, commercial and Defence environments. Over 30 years, we have grown into a sovereign capability provider with operations in Henderson, Perth CBD, Bibra Lake, Karratha, and Melbourne. Our values Safety, Intelligence, Integrity, Inclusivity, and Collaboration guide all project delivery.

Our capabilities span engineering design (all disciplines), building and product design, drafting and drawing conversion, surveying and 3D scanning, engineering data management, conveyor and machine guarding, project management, document control, quality assurance, sustainability consulting, 3D printing (metals/composites), animation, shop detailing, and in-house fabrication. This integrated structure enables CADDS to provide full lifecycle solutions, from concept design to digital engineering, prototyping, fabrication, documentation, and construction support.

CADDS maintains ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 45001 certifications, ensuring high-quality, safe, and environmentally compliant delivery aligned with Defence requirements. Our Henderson presence near the Australian Marine Complex positions us to support Defence maritime and estate projects efficiently.

Recent Defence work includes the **Robertson Barracks Kennel Refurbishment**, where we delivered architectural design, documentation, engineering input, and construction support, and the **Defence Force - Cocos (Keeling) Islands facility upgrades**, providing architectural, engineering, and certification services for remote operational conditions.

CADDS Group continues to expand its sovereign capability through digital engineering, scanning, sustainability, and fabrication capacity, positioning us as a trusted partner to Defence agencies and primes seeking integrated, reliable, and technically robust project solutions.
## Capabilities

CADDS Group delivers end-to-end capability supporting Defence infrastructure, estate upgrades, and operational facilities. Our multidisciplinary services include engineering design (all disciplines), drafting and drawing conversion, surveying and 3D scanning, engineering data management, conveyor and machine guarding, project management, document control, QA, building design, product and industrial design, 3D printing (metals/composites), sustainability consulting, animation, and fabrication including coded welding and shop detailing.

Using advanced digital engineering, BIM modelling, and high-accuracy scanning, we provide as-built capture, clash detection, prototyping, and asset lifecycle documentation. Our remote site support capability enables efficient delivery in regional and remote locations, supported by offices in Henderson, Perth CBD, Karratha, Victoria, and SE Asia.

Our fabrication and 3D printing capabilities enable rapid development of custom components, equipment guards, infrastructure elements, and small-batch manufactured solutions suited to Defence environments. Sustainability services (Emergen) support Defence through energy modelling, environmental compliance, and resilient design.

**Recent Defence projects include:**

- **Robertson Barracks - Kennel Refurbishment (NT):** Architectural design, documentation (Concept, Draft, Final, IFT, IFC) and construction support across multiple buildings, including structural upgrades, roofing, lighting replacement, drainage works, corrosion treatment, and new kennel infrastructure.
- **Defence Force - Cocos (Keeling) Islands:** Architectural, engineering, and certification services supporting facility upgrades, delivering Defence-compliant documentation for remote tropical conditions.

These projects demonstrate CADDS Group's strength in delivering complex, compliance-driven Defence works through integrated design, accurate documentation, digital engineering, and sovereign WA capability.
