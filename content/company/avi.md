## Overview

AVI has been successfully delivering complex communications systems to critical industries demanding exacting specifications and optimal performance, for over 35 years. Founded in 1989, AVI exports on a global scale from world-class facilities in Western Australia.

A privately owned and operated company, AVI has dedicated facilities Australia-wide encompassing engineering, manufacturing and testing as a part of the company's integrated vertical supply chain business model.

AVI's commitment to sovereign capability and complete traceability underpins the design, manufacturing and delivery of secure, sophisticated communications systems and componentry to an international portfolio across Defence, Mining, Government and Space.

AVI products are designed for optimal performance in harsh and challenging conditions and zero-fail environments with an agile product development methodology providing the ability to move quickly from concept verification and design validation, to working prototypes.
## Capabilities

Specialising in the design, development and manufacturing of complex communications solutions and componentry for harsh, remote and critical environments, AVI's robust hardware and innovative technology solutions are used in the most sensitive military, mining, space and security applications, all requiring trusted zero-fail operational performance.

AVI's unique hardware and software-defined communications systems offer an unmet level of agility, responsiveness and interoperability, delivering time-critical, low jitter, low latency, data across secure networks and infrastructure to machines, people and platforms.

An ability to directly respond to industry demands and specialist requirements, is attributable to an end-to-end supply chain, from engineering and design through to prototype development, manufacturing, assembly and testing. World-class, in-house testing facilities ensure optimal performance and reliability of all products across extreme environments and operating conditions.
## Discriminators

AVI's hardened communications solutions are powering some of the biggest industries in the world, providing capabilities for autonomous vehicles, networked battle systems and data management on an exponential scale.

AVI products and technologies have the ability to transform to different missions, including land, sea, air and space; permitting an unmet level of agility, responsiveness, interoperability and performance.

Offering a complete design-to-delivery in-house solution, teamed with a focus on sovereign capability, AVI products are born to perform in harsh and hostile environments.

Rapid growth in the incorporation of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems in key industries has seen AVI transverse key technologies between core markets, with large amounts of associated data to be managed.

AVI's security protocols and complete traceability of all componentry and stages of production, offer the world's most critical industries an Australian-born, trusted option.
