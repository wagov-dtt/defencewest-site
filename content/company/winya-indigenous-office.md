## Overview

WINYA is a majority **Indigenous owned** and controlled business and is the only company in Australia awarded by the **UNITED NATIONS** for Leadership in Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

WINYA was founded in 2015, before any Government Procurement Policies by Kamilaroi people Debbie Barwick and Greg Welsh. WINYA is a **profit-for-purpose** business, creating employment through traineeships across the Australian Furniture Industry for Indigenous people.

WINYA supplies large scale fit outs and furniture to the ATO, Department of Defence and to builders like Built and Lendlease, allowing us to increase our **Indigenous manufacturing employment program** nationally.

WINYA is a big supporter of artists and has one of the largest catalogues of Indigenous artists. WINYA's growing **House Artists Program** aims to feature an artist from every language group, who are paid above industry standard and a fabrication fee for their works.

WINYA maximises its **procurement outreach programs** with timbers from remote communities, robust sustainability and circular economy programs and has created programs in Prisons to train Indigenous inmates to reduce recidivism & build better communities.
