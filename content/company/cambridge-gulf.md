## Overview

CGL has been operating the Port of Wyndham since 1999 and importing fuel into Wyndham since 2004. We have been importing and distributing fuel into Gove since 2013 and distributing fuel in Weipa since 2017. Over this time we have established ourselves as a partner to a number of major mining and agricultural operators in northern Australia whereby we offer whole of supply chain solutions across a number of their operational activities. One example is the Savannah Nickel Mine where we import store and deliver their diesel and also supply tanks and manage their on-site fuel inventory. We also cart their concentrate from the mine site to their Port storage facility, which is located on land that we own, then load it onto vessels for export.
## Capabilities

CGL has operations right across northern Australia in the highly strategic ports of Wyndham, Gove and Weipa. Our Gove and Weipa operations are through 50/50 joint ventures with traditional owners. These are enduring relationships (10 years and 6 years respectively) with well progressed plans for expansion and diversification both in the existing locations and into other areas of Australia. Through our Weipa Bulk Fuels operation, we have developed relationships with a business partner in NSW and another traditional owner group in South Australia with the intention of establishing fuel and logistics operations in both of these locations.

In the East Kimberley we have established a workforce at the Wyndham Port with 70% aboriginal content. Since taking on the Port lease and management, the Port has come very close on three occasions, most recently in 2021, to outtrading the Port of Darwin in terms of tonnage in and out.

Our CEO is also an independent Director for Gelganyem Ltd, the traditional owners of the Argyle Diamond Mine, and has been in this role for the past 11 years. He is assisting the group to navigate through the mine closure process which includes the rehabilitation or re-assignment of strategic assets including the air strip and village.

CGL is also working with other traditional owner groups in the West Kimberley, Pilbara and Northern Territory to expand our joint venture footprint across the north.

CGL's success in establishing aboriginal partnerships across northern Australia delivers a number of significant benefits including the following.

1. Growing aboriginal business and employment in these regions is critical to addressing the economic disadvantage and associated social issues that aboriginal people face in these communities. These initiatives provide role models and employment opportunities for the local aboriginal community members to aspire to.
1. Employing aboriginal people in these remote locations makes sense from an economic perspective. When you employ someone in remote locations like this, you are effectively employing the whole family and not just the individual. Our aboriginal employees and their families want to live in these locations and are not as challenged by the environment and isolation as those families that opt to relocate there.
1. Our traditional owner partners have access to significant land holdings.
1. Our traditional owner partners have the same community values and aspirations as CGL's shareholders, and we are both equally as driven to ensure that any of our business ventures also delivers social benefits to the communities we operate in.

CGL is also working with a farmers' co-operative in Esperance to establish a fuel retail and distribution network.

CGL's footprint across the north along with our proven ability to diversify and our success in delivering enduring business and employment outcomes for aboriginal people makes us a unique and valued partner for the ADF.
