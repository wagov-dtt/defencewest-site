## Capabilities

Pursuit of excellence is the philosophy that drives the Clough Projects culture. This philosophy is at the core of our value system, which embodies the areas of zero harm, performance, productivity, client focus, integrity and innovation. These values guide and align the implementation of corporate initiatives
to address industry challenges and help our clients achieve operational excellence. Clough's global track record includes more than 95 years in Australia, over 30 years in PNG and Asia, and expansion into Europe, Middle East and Africa, and North America. We provide services across three key phases of the asset life cycle - engineering, construction and operations. These functions deliver high-value services to blue chip clients operating in the oil and gas, petrochemical, metals, minerals, infrastructure and marine sectors. Clough specifically reduces project risk by providing a complete engineering and project services solution.
We engineer to construct and construct to commission, operate and maintain facilities, optimising safety, productivity and cost across every phase of a project. This project execution expertise has been developed through work on some of the world's most logistically challenging energy and resources projects, and provides a fresh approach for customers looking for a new way of contracting.
