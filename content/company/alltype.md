- Alltype Engineering** is an Australian-owned and operated company with a proud legacy of supporting the nation's defence sector through specialised **Structural, Mechanical, Piping, Electrical and Instrumentation (SMPE&I)** services. We deliver infrastructure fabrication, construction, and vessel maintenance solutions across all branches of the Australian Defence Force, with the majority of works delivered for the Australian Navy and Airforce.

Our capabilities span direct engagements with the Commonwealth of Australia and collaborative projects with both civilian and military contractors. We have contributed to critical base infrastructure projects, including steelwork, mechanical installations and complex piping systems that support essential fuelling, utilities, and operational networks.

Alltype Engineering has played a key role in the lifecycle maintenance of combat and support vessels, with notable contributions to naval assets such as **HMAS Westralia, HMAS Swan, and HMAS Torrens**. Our teams have operated at secure defence locations including **HMAS Stirling** at Garden Island and **Curtin Air Base** in remote northwest Western Australia, consistently meeting stringent security and compliance standards.

With decades of experience, we continue to deliver high-quality, reliable engineering solutions that enhance the operational readiness and sustainability of Australia's defence capabilities. Our commitment to **precision, safety, and innovation** drives continuous improvement and ensures we exceed the expectations of our defence clients.
