## Overview

Since 2010, Zellabox has been a world leader and specialist in the provision of micro data centres. From our WA base, micro data centres are delivered to a range of locations - from remote mining sites and satellite locations to office buildings in major cities. Customers span five continents and a wide range of industries including telecommunications, government, defence, education, healthcare, and mining.

## Capabilities

Zellabox micro data centres are the product of our company’s rigorous research and development process and close relationship with customers. Our modular micro data centres provide all the same capabilities as a traditional data centre, but with a footprint roughly the size of a kitchen refrigerator.
