## Overview

Indrus provides real-time asset tracking solutions for large-scale facilities managing vehicles, equipment, and personnel. We've been developing this technology for over 2 years, transforming existing CCTV infrastructure into comprehensive tracking systems without requiring additional hardware. Our ability to deliver facility-wide visibility comes from deep expertise in advanced computer vision and geospatial tracking algorithms honed through working with major infrastructure globally including ports and 3PL organisations.
## Capabilities

- Facility-Wide Asset Visibility:** Our proprietary computer vision system transforms existing CCTV infrastructure into a comprehensive tracking network, providing real-time location data for vehicles, equipment, and personnel across entire facilities. The technology achieves millimetre GPS accuracy without requiring additional hardware installation, preserving operational security by eliminating trackable devices.

- Operational Situational Awareness:** Beyond asset tracking, the system provides continuous visibility of facility-wide activity patterns, unusual movements, and unauthorised access to restricted areas. This provides real-time awareness of all personnel and vehicle movements across the entire facility, enabling rapid response to security incidents, breach detection, and force protection scenarios without relying on manual monitoring of multiple camera feeds.

- Automated Inventory and Reconciliation:** The system automatically maintains asset registries, tracking movement histories, dwell times, and location patterns. This eliminates manual inspection requirements while providing immediate answers to asset location queries. For defence logistics, this means rapid equipment accountability during exercises, deployments, or audits without dedicating personnel to physical searches.

- Secure On-Premises Processing:** All data processing occurs within facility infrastructure with no external cloud dependencies, maintaining information sovereignty critical for defence operations. Encrypted data transmission and strict access controls ensure operational security while enabling authorised personnel to access tracking data through role-based permissions
## Discriminators

- Technological Innovation:**

- Proprietary pixel-to-GPS calibration technology achieving millimetre accuracy
- World's first seamless multi-camera tracking across entire facilities without hardware dependencies
- Trajectory-based identification maintaining asset identity where visual recognition fails
- Adaptable system architecture spanning facility types and asset classes with rapid deployment

- Operational Advantages:**

- Rapid deployment timeline (operational within weeks versus 6-12 months for hardware solutions)
- 90% lower implementation costs compared to GPS/RFID tracking systems
- Zero ongoing hardware maintenance burden or battery management requirements
- Compatible with all network-connected camera systems regardless of manufacturer
