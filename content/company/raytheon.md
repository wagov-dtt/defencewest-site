## Overview

Raytheon Australia is the Australian arm of the Raytheon Company, a major US defence contractor and industrial corporation with core manufacturing concentrations in weapons and military and commercial electronics. The Australian operation was established in 1999, and has since grown to become one of the largest US-owned defence contractors operating in Australia. In WA, our Henderson facility has now become home to more
than 148 employees with expertise working on the Collins combat system in-service support program. In addition to the Collins class work in Western Australia, for over
7 years, Raytheon Australia has managed, operated and maintained the facilities, systems, equipment and devices located at the Harold E Holt (HEH) Naval Communication Station. The facility provides continuous, strategic and tactical communications with submarines for the Naval forces of the United States, Australia and allied nations. Other principal company facilities in Australia are maintained at Techport (Adelaide), Macquarie Park (Sydney), Murarrie (Brisbane), Carole Park (Brisbane) and headquarters in Canberra (ACT).
## Capabilities

For over 15 years, we have developed and maintained a strong relationship with the Australian Defence Force (ADF) through our position as a trusted partner in support of the Navy's Collins-class submarines. Local activities comprise combat system design, development, integration and test as well as complex project management, integrated logistics support and technical governance. Following on from our involvement in the successful Combat System Augmentation program, we were selected for the Collins
Replacement Combat System (RCS) program, and tasked with designing and delivering the combat systems hardware necessary to accommodate the US Navy's AN/BYG-1 Tactical Weapon Control System. In this role, Raytheon Australia became responsible for the enterprise architecture, systems hardware and software engineering necessary for the design, development, test and delivery of the interface between the AN/BYG-1 system and a range of legacy and new sensors on the Collins platform. In addition to the Henderson site, we maintain a dedicated Collins workforce at HMAS Stirling, Outer Harbour (South Australia), Canberra and Sydney. By establishing these co-located operations with our naval customer, we have maximised collaboration efforts across multiple areas of the enterprise.
