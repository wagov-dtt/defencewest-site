## Overview

**Capability X was established in 2023 and has grown rapidly, securing contracts with ASX-listed companies in the Marine, Oil and Gas, and Logistics sectors, as well as contracts with the Western Australia Police.**

CX is currently expanding further into the defence sector and has established MOUs with companies that supply to the Australian Defence Force.

Capability X is in active discussions with both Defence and major defence contractors regarding the deployment of CX technology.

CX has also hosted defence primes at its remote operations facility, showcasing the company's remote operations and subsea capability.
## Capabilities

At **CX**, we're redefining how defence forces see, manage, and control complex and high-risk operations -- in real time, across any theatre of operation.

Our plug-and-play computer vision AI transforms any military worksite -- from a forward operating base to a defence logistics hub or naval vessel -- into a persistent, real-time digital twin. Much like a next-generation command dashboard, it provides a live 3D operational picture, automatically identifying unsafe conditions, people, equipment, potential collisions, equipment hazards, and mission-critical deviations. When a threat or risk is detected, the system issues instant visual and audio alerts in the field, while simultaneously notifying commanders and remote decision-makers. The result: enhanced situational awareness, reduced incidents, faster responses, and improved force protection.

Our second product line enables **global remote operations from a single, deployable case**. Using our ruggedised, pelican-sized system, operators can establish a secure link to our remote operations centre in under five minutes and take positive control of ROVs, UAVs, and autonomous or tele-operated robotic systems anywhere in the world. It's hardened, fast, and designed for contested, degraded, and austere environments.

Together, these technologies provide defence leaders with full operational visibility, heightened safety, and true remote capability -- bridging the gap between the physical battlespace and the digital command environment, and giving forces a decisive operational advantage.
## Discriminators

- **Advanced AI, Automation & Robotics Expertise** - CX designs, manufactures, and operates cutting-edge AI, automation, and robotics systems entirely from its headquarters in Perth, ensuring sovereign capability and full local lifecycle control.
- **Purpose-Built National Infrastructure** - CX has developed its operational infrastructure from the ground up, including a remote operations base located at the Perth International Telecommunications Centre--one of the largest satellite communication facilities in the Southern Hemisphere--providing unparalleled connectivity, resilience, and security for remote and autonomous systems.
- **Industry Recognition & Awards** - CX was recognised for excellence in robotics and artificial intelligence as the winner of the **2025 Robopoolza Robotics & AI Award**, demonstrating industry-leading innovation and technical capability.
- **Strong Academic & Research Partnerships** - CX maintains a strategic alliance with the University of Western Australia (UWA), collaborating across multiple applied research programs in generative AI and advanced robotics. This partnership combines academic depth, leading-edge research, SME agility, and the extensive industry experience of the CX engineering and operations team.
- **Established Defence & Industry Engagement** - CX is actively engaged with defence primes, ASX-listed companies, and major government agencies, providing proven technology solutions across marine, subsea, oil and gas, logistics, and law enforcement sectors, with MOUs in place with companies supplying to the Australian Defence Force.
