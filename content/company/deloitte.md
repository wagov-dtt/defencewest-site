## Overview

Working with government and industry, we look at the most strategic ways to help navigate today's unpredictable geo-political and threat landscape and offer agile solutions that can promote a stronger more sustainable agenda across defence.

Serving government agencies across defence, industry and the intelligence community, we are well-versed in the key pillars of national security.

Leveraging our Deloitte insights, we work with government and industry to deliver agile solutions spanning across defence, industry, national security, indo-pacific relations, to equip agencies with the information and technology needed to make strategic decisions at each turn.

From cyber and cloud to strategy, visualisation and mission analytics, we can drive bold and lasting results that help keep your defence and industry agenda strong without sacrificing your mission.
## Capabilities

Backed by our cutting-edge services and solutions, how will you shape a more incredible tomorrow?

**Industry Strategy and Ecosystems**

Our Industry Strategy and Ecosystems team shapes the strategic direction of evolving and emerging industries. We support organisations and their ecosystems to understand and respond to prevailing global challenges, creating outcomes that will leave the world in a better place than we found it.

**Value Chain Transformation**

It's crucial to have an in-depth understanding of your value chain so you can focus on what generates the best outcomes. With offerings such as Illuminate, we build resilience through digital intelligence that provides visibility of your supply chains, improving transparency across multiple tiers. We help you leverage big data analytics and augmented intelligence to generate comprehensive supplier network maps, identifying opportunities and risk exposures, and turning them into actionable, industry-specific insights.

**Digital Twins and Simulation**

Reimagine your ecosystems into a dynamically run and operated network by converting the physical to digital with our digital twin, simulation and machine learning technologies. Through [Optimal Reality](https://www.deloitte.com/au/en/products/optimal-reality-digital-twin.html), we help you understand your business - of now and of the future - so you can control and action change in real-time, with tangible results.

**Product Strategy and Lifecyle Management**

We create smart, safe and sustainable products along the digital thread so you can manage, simulate and improve assets, from business needs through to disposal. Using our product lifecycle management expertise, we create the digital backbone you need to be a business of today and tomorrow.

**Industry 4.0 and Emerging Industrial Technology**

This is where we integrate and accelerate the industrial technology needed to improve our world by connecting technology, ecosystems, and reality together, in real-time.
