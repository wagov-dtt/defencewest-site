## Overview

Adisyn is an Australian-owned, ASX-listed technology company (ASX: AI1) specialising in secure IT and Cybersecurity services for critical industries, including Defence, space, government, and health.

With headquarters in Western Australia and operations nationwide, Adisyn has built a reputation for delivering high-assurance services tailored to regulated environments. We provide end-to-end capability under our *Advise - Support - Protect* framework, enabling Defence and aligned organisations to operate with confidence, control, and compliance.

Our history includes supporting Defence through sovereign-managed IT support, uplift programs aligned to the Essential Eight, ISO 27001 implementation, and providing expert guidance to DISP applicants. Our leadership team includes veterans and former Defence contractors, bringing firsthand understanding of operational demands and security imperatives.

Adisyn's approach balances cyber maturity with commercial pragmatism--helping clients reduce complexity while strengthening posture and meeting statutory obligations. Whether delivering high-performance infrastructure, securing remote deployments, or ensuring compliance in disconnected or bandwidth-constrained environments, our solutions are built for real-world conditions.

We are proud to contribute to Australia's national security landscape through technology solutions that are local, trusted, and mission-focused.
