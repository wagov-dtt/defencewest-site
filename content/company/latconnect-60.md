## Overview

LATCONNECT 60 is a Western Australian earth observation space company in growth phase. It was formed in 2019 with the objective to provide responsive, high fidelity, rapid re-visit earth observation data to enhance commercial and defence ISR activities. It has acquired capacity of an existing satellite in-orbit to capture high resolution multispectral data exclusive to Australia and with global access. Satellite constellation expansion is in progress with a follow-on launch in 2022.

LATCONNECT 60 is partnering with Governments, Research Institutions and major Space Industry players globally to deliver vital insights for our world. The data and its derived solutions are applicable to all industrial, commercial and government purposes. The significant benefits include immediate tasking, unique insights and very competitive pricing.
## Capabilities

LatConnect 60 will be the first private high resolution satellite imaging operator in Western Australia and a leading satellite operator in Australia. With its satellite operations centre based in Perth, it will be able to deliver:

- Immediate real-time tasking from Australia
- Data downlinking via local WA ground station & supported by international ground stations
- Sub-metre resolution earth observation imagery daily to multiple times a day

LatConnect 60 has also developed platforms for data visualisation and insights, with algorithms and processes to make the data immediately useful. Combination and fusion of our imagery with other data types is also available for enhanced insights.
