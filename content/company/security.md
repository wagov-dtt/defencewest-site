## Overview

Security Consulting Group (SCG) specialises in providing independent protective security, threat and risk analysis and communications consultancy services to high profile clients operating in unique and challenging security environments. Founded in 2014, our Directors identified a need for a specialised provider of security advice outside of the major multi-disciplinary firms. SCG provide a focused delivery of security consulting services in the areas of Defence, Federal Government, Justice, and Critical Infrastructure sectors. As a national practice with established offices in Melbourne, Perth Sydney, Canberra, and Brisbane, SCG is ideally positioned to service the immediate and long-term needs of Australia's strategic security and infrastructure projects. We are also proud to be a certified Australian Veteran Owned Business - and we draw on many of our team's backgrounds in military, intelligence, government and defence services for the benefit of our clients and our communities.
## Capabilities

The SCG team is comprised of well-known industry leading professionals, and includes one of the largest groups of SCEC endorsed security consultants in Australia, delivering key security and infrastructure projects for defence and government clients. SCG has developed a holistic security strategy, based on a simple but tested security philosophy, which responds to our clients' operational requirements, their risks and business needs. We are proud of our contribution to the delivery of many complex security projects, both locally and overseas, with our track record in security and communications services widely recognised.
