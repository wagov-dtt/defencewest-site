## Overview

Segnut Pty Ltd has developed an innovative direct replacement for a traditional threaded nut. The resulting "Segnut" incorporates proprietary designs that allow fast and safe nut release (2-3 seconds), even when bolt threads are damaged or seized. The problem of seized/ jammed nuts becomes most acute during mission critical times (eg: during production shut downs for maintenance). Maintenance tasks often require the removal of many hundreds or even thousands of nuts in order to service production equipment. When a nut seizes, resort is often made to high energy removal methods such as "gas-axing" (the oxy cutting of bolts/nuts) which involve hazardous
procedures, increased safety risks and the need to secure surrounding equipment. Alternatives include high energy, bulky hydraulic nut splitters or resort to drilling out the bolt centre. The Segnut solution offers an effective alternative, and thus makes a very compelling business case as a direct and interchangeable replacement for a standard nut.
## Capabilities

There is no direct competitor to the Segnut. There are various methods and materials aimed at reducing the likelihood of nut seizure (eg: Denso tape, anti-seize coatings, etc), but these often depend on operator skill and diligence for proper execution and may deteriorate over time and environmental exposure. None of the alternatives prevent seizure in the event of thread damage.
The Segnut is able to release cleanly and efficiently even if the bolt thread has been damaged and also incurs less costs in materials and/or labour. Segnut's design is the only one on the market that is interchangeable with standard threaded fasteners and allow efficient upgrading and change-over. Because of the compatibility of Segnuts with standard nuts, back-to-back trialling with standard nuts is possible for any particular application.
