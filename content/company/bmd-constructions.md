## Overview

BMD is a national group of companies engaged in engineering design, construction and land development for clients and partners in the defence, urban development, transport infrastructure and resources and energy sectors.

Since 1979, BMD has employed a relationship based business model founded on certainty, collaboration and performance.

With approximately 1,700 staff throughout Australia, BMD has the resources and experience to deliver projects ranging in size from $1 million to over $1 billion. At BMD, we see our strengths in the quality of our people and our genuine relationships with clients, partners and communities.

We see our success linked to our ability to deliver certainty through consistent performance. We see our future shaped by all that has made us successful in the past.

## Capabilities

BMD has a thorough understanding of the Department of Defence's compliance requirements and security protocols, and the in-house capability to design, construct, upgrade and maintain defence infrastructure in metropolitan, regional and remote communities across Australia.

Our experienced project teams can deliver base upgrades, airfield runways, taxiways and aprons, defence training facilities, housing and landscaping, as well as install and relocate utility services such as stormwater, wastewater and pipework.
