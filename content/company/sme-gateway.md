## Overview

SME Gateway has a proven heritage of over 15 years in support of Australian Small to Medium Enterprises and the low-risk facilitation of their introduction to a wide range of work opportunities in the provision of Professional and Technical Services. We are not a recruitment or labour-hire group but a contractual Tier 1 conduit for SMEs to pursue opportunities in areas that may otherwise prove challenging to identify, qualify, or be perceived as holding increased risk.

SME Gateway has developed a strong reputation as a trusted provider to a wide range of Whole of Government agencies, to date responsible for over $500m worth of contracts being awarded to Australian SMEs. From a foundation built on supporting Federal and State Procurement Panels, SME Gateway is now diversifying to provide services directly. This engagement will be to Primes, undertaking Integrated Work Packages to deliver Coordinated Services, driving Business To Business (B2B) engagement between our members and developing SME Consortiums. Member companies number over 400 nationally, with a firm commitment for growth in Western Australia.
## Capabilities

SME Gateway offers a unique level of access to Australian SME Professional and Technical Services capability for our clients and a proven and highly effective subcontracting model for our members.

SMEs keen to work in "Above The Line" opportunities through Federal and State Procurement Panels can compete for roles as a member of SME Gateway's 400+ national community of companies, without the challenge of having to qualify as a participant on the Panels individually.

Those keen to work in more "Below The Line" environments are provided with opportunities for single tasks/roles or work packages through our growing list of Prime contractor clients.

SME Gateway does not preselect or match members to opportunities. The model is transparent, from the distribution of opportunities to the entire membership group to the commonality of the Relationship Agreements between SME Gateway and our members.

Our clients can tap into a comprehensive spectrum of over 140 distinct capabilities and skillsets. SME Gateway contractually engages and is accountable for resource location, performance monitoring, contract management, invoicing and governance. Short-and long-term opportunities vary from single resource roles to SME Gateway developed and led teams to deliver outcomes within Integrated Work Packages. All this is through providing sustained support to SME companies and contributing to our Clients' AIC obligations.
