## Overview

Allied Heat Transfer designs, manufactures, services and repairs all types of heat exchangers for the marine, mining, drilling, industrial and power generation sectors.
Our engineering team ensures that all plans comply to relevant standards and regulations, and customer projects are fully complete.
Our design capability includes thermal calculations, mechanical calculations and air flow calculations. Applicable codes and standards include AS1200, AS1210, AS1170, AS1554, AS1665, AS3992, AS4037, AS4458, ASME Section VIII. Div 1, ASME Section 1, API and TEMA.
## Capabilities

manufacture; and maintain; which combine as a one-stop solution for our customers.
The founding directors and shareholders share over 100 years of experience in the heat exchanger industry. Since being established
in 2000, our company has grown and now operates four branches internationally.
We have obtained two heat exchanger tube patents - enhanced tube performance and safety tube performance. This demonstrates our ability to enhance, customize and safely conduct a broad range of heat exchanger projects. AHT uniquely holds U Stamp,
U2 Stamp and R Stamp accreditations. Compliances include: pressure vessels to ASME Section VIII Div 1; pressure vessels to ASME Section VIII Div 2; and repairs to vessels. We can conduct a full analysis of an industrial cooling system and recommend bespoke improvements and solutions. Problem solving of existing installations can be carried out with both thermal and mechanical checking.
Our ability to undertake the analysis of existing heat exchangers and industrial cooling systems while the equipment is still in service has provided significant benefits for our customers. Customers also benefit from our in-house engineering knowledge and experience in the application of design and manufacturing expertise to satisfy customer specifications and requirements. This level of expertise is what separates our company from our competition.
