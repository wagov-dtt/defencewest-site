## Overview

Fugro is a world-leading, independent provider of geo-intelligence and asset integrity solutions for large constructions, infrastructure and natural resources. We provide the technical data and information required to design, construct and maintain structures and infrastructure in a safe, reliable and efficient manner. Working around the globe, predominantly in the energy and infrastructure markets, we employ approximately 10,000 employees in 65 countries. Fugro Remote Systems Technology provides specialist expertise in subsea engineering, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) tooling design and bespoke intervention equipment. Our engineered solutions meet a vast array of subsea inspection, repair and maintenance requirements. Utilising ROV-based solutions, our specialised engineers develop tailor-made equipment and procedures to undertake vessel mobilisations and intricate remote subsea repairs.
## Capabilities

Together with extensive offshore experience, our engineering capability enables us to provide innovative engineering solutions that push the boundaries of remote intervention. We combine traditional engineering calculations, industry leading engineering software products and our proprietary subsea simulation software - DeepworksTM - to provide comprehensive design solutions. This allows proposed design solutions to be simulated, trialled and demonstrated before any commitment to manufacturing. 3D models of our designs are imported into the simulation software which allows engineers or ROV pilots to fly and operate the design and highlight any areas for improvement. Utilising this capability early in the design phase allows us to optimise designs, thus increasing confidence in the viability of a proposed solution. This factor is invaluable in securing budgets and management buy-in for proposed projects.
