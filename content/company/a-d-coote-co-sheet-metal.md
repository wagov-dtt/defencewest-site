## Overview

A.D. Coote & Co is a Western Australian–based, Australian-owned fabrication business with experience supporting high-compliance industries including infrastructure, mining, oil and gas, and commercial construction, as well as defence-aligned activities.

The company specialises in sheet metal and heavy fabrication, delivering bespoke components and structural assemblies for demanding operating environments. This includes fabrication works undertaken for Broadspectrum in support of defence-aligned infrastructure, such as the manufacture and refurbishment of shooting target systems and associated fabricated components. These works required adherence to strict safety, quality, and technical requirements, and were delivered in accordance with client specifications and controlled site conditions.

Beyond defence-aligned projects, A.D. Coote & Co has an established history of working with Tier-1 contractors and asset owners across critical industries, requiring disciplined quality assurance, traceability, and schedule management. This experience has developed systems and processes that are directly transferable to Defence supply chain expectations.

A.D. Coote & Co operates under an ISO-certified quality management system and maintains a strong focus on safety, compliance with Australian Standards, and continuous improvement. The workforce is experienced in interpreting engineered drawings and technical documentation, enabling reliable and repeatable fabrication outcomes.

As a WA metropolitan manufacturer, A.D. Coote & Co contributes to Australia’s sovereign industrial capability through local fabrication, a skilled Australian workforce, and established relationships with Australian suppliers. The company sees the defence sector as a strategic growth area and is committed to supporting defence infrastructure and sustainment programs through dependable, locally delivered fabrication services.

## Capabilities

A.D. Coote & Co offers a broad range of fabrication capabilities supporting defence infrastructure, facilities, and sustainment requirements. The company combines in-house design capability with precision manufacturing, enabling efficient delivery from concept through to fabrication and installation.

Core capabilities include precision laser cutting, forming, welding, and assembly of sheet metal and heavy fabricated components. Operating from a large WA metropolitan facility, the business supports both one-off and small-to-medium production runs, as well as larger fabricated assemblies.

A.D. Coote & Co has extensive experience fabricating a wide range of materials, including all grades of stainless steel, aluminium, carbon steel, brass, and titanium. Welding is undertaken using MIG and TIG processes by highly trained and certified welders, ensuring structural integrity, durability, and compliance with relevant Australian Standards.

These capabilities have been applied to defence-aligned projects through works undertaken for Broadspectrum, including fabrication and refurbishment of shooting target systems and associated components for controlled-use facilities. This work demonstrated the company’s ability to meet strict safety, quality, and technical requirements within defence-related environments.

The company also designs and manufactures light steel and aluminium lighting structures, including fabricated light poles, applicable to defence bases, training facilities, and precinct infrastructure. An experienced on-site installation team supports end-to-end delivery, underpinned by an ISO-certified quality management system and strong safety culture.
