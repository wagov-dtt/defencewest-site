## Overview

At present, we do not have any direct contracts within the defence industry. Our strategy however over the last few months has been to do 4 things.

1. Navigate the Defence Readiness tool via ODIS, which we are in the process of.

1. Meet the 5 relevant GSC prime contacts where Electro Base capability aligns, specifically BAE (Net Carbon Zero capability need), Lockheed Martin (Energy and Power, specifically Energy Management and Storage capability need), Moog (Directed Energy Technology), Babcock (Vehicle Fleet Services and Vehicles Systems Support capability need) and Raytheon (Battery Technologies capability)

1. Establish relationships with WA companies who are already in the defence supply chain. For example, Innovaero.

1. Lastly, we are applying for the DINAMIC Commercialisation Bootcamp. coming up online in April 2025 to explore further opportunities for EFD and Technical Incubation opportunities.
## Capabilities

Direct examples of where Electro Base capability aligns with the defence industry is specific to off-grid power and e-mobility charging needs.

For example, BAE's need to be able to charge the STRIX eVTOL. Our Australian engineered and made Energy Management System (EMS) is designed for off-grid charging capabilities with dynamic load management which means the ability to charge remotely anytime, anywhere is possible. As our product is Australian made, the risk to cyber attacks and energy insecurity is mitigated. Another application would be for the direct charging of the Bushmaster ePMV. Our direct DC to DC fast charging means that the Bushmaster 113kWh battery could be charged in less than an hour and faster using faster DC charging capabilities.
## Discriminators

1. Base Energy Management System is 100% Australian engineered and made, making it a secure system at reduced risk to cyber attacks.
1. Dynamic load management ensures the system always prioritises charging crucial infrastructure and limiting charging for non-crucial.
1. Energy Management System is hardware agnostic which means we can code it to any battery, inverter, renewable energy source allowing for redundancy and future proofing.
