## Overview

iCetana is a world leader in the provision of real-time artificial intelligence (AI) assisted video monitoring to service the demands of a complex world. We believe it is a shortcoming of modern technology that surveillance equipment requires constant monitoring by human eyes, so we have redesigned the technology to provide better outcomes by seeing through the chaos and identifying undesirable events first.

## Capabilities

Our capabilities are focused on real-time AI-assisted video monitoring software. The key point here is real-time. We don't just record what happened in the past. We proactively monitor the present to identify issues first. This contrasts to existing systems which only alert operators once something has gone wrong. To iCetana, that is one step too late. Our software uses a rolling baseline to learn daily - constantly establishing a 'new normal' set of behaviours to proactively identify the abnormal and alert operators to changes. Our system displays only undesirable events to security operators in real time, thus preventing monitoring fatigue and boredom while increasing engagement. Security operators then need only to proactively assess and respond to events that matter. Designed to scale to thousands of cameras in one installation, our system future proofs video surveillance infrastructure. Our AI-assisted video monitoring analyses what is normal across a whole scene, looks for the not normal and then alerts operators as to the difference.
