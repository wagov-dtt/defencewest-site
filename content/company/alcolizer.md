Established in 1987, we have grown from a local manufacturer into a leading provider of drug and alcohol testing solutions across Australia and New Zealand. Our commitment to quality and reliability has made us a trusted partner to industries critical to national security, including Defence.

From the outset, Alcolizer Technology has focused on developing technology that meets the unique demands of Australian conditions. All our systems are designed and manufactured at our primary facility in Balcatta, WA, ensuring sovereign capability and compliance with stringent national and international standards.

We provide advanced drug and alcohol testing devices and professional onsite testing services to Defence and its contractors, as well as key agencies such as Australian Police, Border Force, CASA, and the Department of Home Affairs. By supporting these organisations, we help safeguard critical national security operations and maintain compliance in high-risk environments. Our team members hold security credentials appropriate to Defence requirements, ensuring trusted access and integrity when operating in sensitive settings. Each year, our systems facilitate over 25 million breath alcohol tests and tens of thousands of drug tests, demonstrating the scale and reliability of our operations.

With nationwide service teams and an international distribution network, Alcolizer Technology is positioned to support Defence infrastructure projects at scale--delivering technology that lasts, backed by service that understands the sector's unique requirements.
