## Overview

Phase was established with a singular focus: to enhance Australia's access to sovereign critical technology. We bridge the gap between government, academia, and industry to enable meaningful National Security innovation to occur.
## Capabilities

To achieve this, we work across technologies with our primary focus on those critical technologies with a clear application within, or contribution to the National Security Community. Our ecosystem supports the development of advanced technology solutions using artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum tech, autonomous systems, cyber capabilities, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and space tech.

We offer two services:

Phase Foresight. Our translator. A bespoke advisory driving public - private fusion, distilling capability requirement's, connecting talent and enabling clients to collaborate with National Security stakeholders.

Phase Generator. Our builder. A capability incubator and accelerator connecting ideas and deep / early-stage technology with the experience, talent, resources and end user input required to develop and commercialise impactful capability.
