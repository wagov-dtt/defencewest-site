## Overview

Qube is Australia's largest integrated provider of import and export logistics services, covering the complete supply chain from beginning to end. We are a leader in the markets in which we operate, striving continuously to implement innovative practices that enhance our customers' experience.\
The expertise of each of our divisions is showcased in the statements below. Qube Bulk currently handles more than 85 million tonnes per annum of bulk products and, with our continued involvement in a number of bulk commodity handling projects, these volumes are expected to increase. We empower our people to deliver exceptional results for our customers every day, and we pride ourselves in offering a safe and inclusive workplace. We encourage innovation and collaboration to ensure we exceed industry standards throughout our organisation. Qube focuses on providing a safe workplace through our Zero Harm programs, and we are committed to working with the local communities in which we operate
## Capabilities

Qube Bulk capabilities include mine, road, rail, storage, port and ship services. Qube Bulk handles various bulk ores, concentrates, mineral sands, salt, coal and dangerous goods. We own and operate strategic infrastructure throughout the supply chain. Qube Bulk is independent, experienced and actively investing in bulk export chain projects. This combination provides customers with a low risk solution. Independence is particularly useful in open access facilities where there are multiple users. Where possible, we look to invest in bulk material handling systems and port facilities.\
Our customers benefit directly from our extensive experience in project development, supply chain management, port operations, and the design, development and operation of infrastructure. We work with exporters, rail operators and port owners, and we understand the complex interaction between the various stakeholders. With substantial experience in the operation of largescale, bulk export facilities and bulk material supply chains, we offer significant value.
