## Overview

OLEOLOGY's expertise in water treatment systems includes advanced solutions to recycle and decontaminate water quicker, simpler, and more cost-effective.

Incorporating the MyCelx technology, which efficiently removes organics, oils, hydrocarbons, Mercury and PFAS to below detectable levels, OLEOLOGY's solution is a small footprint solution that is designed to remove free oil, dispersed and emulsified hydrocarbons to the environment, well below EPA requirements.

While other oil-water separators rely on mechanical separation or chemicals, MyCelx bonds with oil and other contaminants at a molecular level. This means oils, hydrocarbons, and other contaminants are removed almost completely without any water loss.

Some of MyCelx's many benefits are:
• Oil Contaminant levels reduced to less than 1ppm.
• No release back into the water
• Designed to any flow rate and discharge requirements.
• Easy to install, operate and maintain.
• Low power requirements.
• Small Footprint, Low-pressure drop, High Throughput.
• Skid mount or Containerized.
• Environmentally Green Engineered Oily Water Filtration and Hydrocarbon Odour Removal.
• The only technology certified by Lloyd's Register for oily water treatment and discharge into marine environments.
• Economical - Lowest capital and competitive operating costs.
