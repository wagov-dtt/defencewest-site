## Capabilities

The Sapien product suite is the only system capable of enabling Cyber Risk in OT environments to be managed in the same way as other Risks to Defence Operations such as geo-political situations or extreme weather events. It delivers Cyber Vulnerability and Threat intelligence fully contextualised to the actual risks presented to the specific defence systems monitored using the IEC 62443 methodology. Other Vendors Vulnerability and Threat management systems rely on generic risk calculations typically based on the Purdue model which do not take into account system function or connectivity. As an Australian sovereign business, Sapien works closely with Edith Cowan University to further develop the skills of the latest graduates of Cyber within Australia.
