## Overview

Red Piranha is Australia's leading developer, manufacturer, and exporter of cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions.

Crystal Eye offers unparalleled Threat Detection, Investigation, and Response (TDIR) with integrated Cyber Threat Intelligence.

Recognised with multiple awards, Red Piranha is a proud member of Team Defence Australia and the first Oceanic member of the prestigious Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) in Washington, D.C., consistently delivering top-tier threat intelligence globally. We are featured in the Australian Defence Export Catalogue representing our commitment towards data sovereignty globally.

Crystal Eye excels at identifying and correlating high-quality Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) associated with Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activities, including advanced lateral movement and Living off the Land (LotL) tactics that often go undetected by traditional cybersecurity solutions. Our state-of-the-art technology empowers organisations to detect, assess, and respond to both known and unknown threats swiftly and efficiently. Our proactive threat hunting and investigation, conducted by our security experts, significantly reduce threat dwell time.

Supported by a suite of cybersecurity services--including vulnerability and penetration testing, digital forensics, threat intelligence, managed security services, incident response planning, corporate and staff training, and vCISO/eCISO(tm) solutions--Red Piranha delivers a holistic cybersecurity program.

Red Piranha is actively involved with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government of Western Australia, and Austrade.

Our comprehensive cybersecurity technology is 100% proprietary, with all IPs internally owned and manufactured. As a 100% Australian-owned and managed company, we are uniquely positioned as a developer and manufacturer of Australian-made products.

Red Piranha aims to solidify its role as a leading global cybersecurity provider.
