Our work in the Defence sector spans long-term contracts such as the ASMD. AMCAP and ANZAC group maintenance contracts. This work has seen us acknowledged for our ability to work in challenging environments based on our vigilance towards safety and environmental considerations, whilst working effectively with other contractors.
