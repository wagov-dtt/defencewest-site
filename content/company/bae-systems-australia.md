## Capabilities

With the largest ship lift in WA, and indeed one of the largest in Australia, our Henderson shipyard prides itself on being a world-class facility to execute customer projects in a safe, flexible but timely manner, whilst meeting schedule and budget. With our own in-house Dock Master and Docking crews, we offer unmatched services to the commercial maritime sector including maintenance, repairs, refits/upgrades and conversion of: offshore supply vessels; survey vessels; anchor handlers; construction barges; dive vessels; tugs; motor yachts; container and bulk carriers; tankers; in-field supply vessels; dredges; trawlers and seismic vessels. The 8,000 tonne ship lift can accommodate vessels that are up to 150 metres in length and 24.5 metres beam, and provides access to a number of fully-serviced dry berths via a rotary turntable, which provides the flexibility to dock and undock multiple vessels to help meet stringent customer docking schedules. BAE Systems has invested over $30m in the last four years to develop a world-class facility and secure a long-term future in commercial and naval ship repair. Our aim is to deliver efficient value for money solutions to customers, through strong performance and drawing on the experience and strength of our world-wide company. Accreditations include: ISO9001:2008 (Quality); AS4801:2001 (Safety, Health) and ISO14001:2004 (Environment). We employ a flexible workforce that can undertake multiple projects spanning maintenance, repairs and conversions; can support off-site project mobilisation and riding crews; maintain an in-house engineering design capability; and can draw on an extensive specialist sub-contractor database, many of whom are Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) accredited.
