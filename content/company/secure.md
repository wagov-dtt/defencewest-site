## Overview

Secure Systems Limited specialises in the design and manufacture of secure portable storage technology for high assurance applications. The company has developed the award winning Silicon Data Vault(r) secure data storage and execution technology.
This technology has been commercialised into an Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) certified high assurance portable data storage device that is approved for use in the protection of Defence's most highly classified data.
## Capabilities

Our Silicon Data Vault - High Assurance (SDV-HA) product is the only secure portable storage device certified by the ASD to store Top Secret data, yet it can also be handled as an Unclassified device when not powered on. Highly-sensitive data can therefore be transported by personnel without the need for a safe-hand courier. Unique features
of the SDV-HA include: a tamper detection and response sub-system that continuously monitors and cryptographically deletes all data upon detecting a tamper event; strong encryption of all stored data; strong 2-factor authentication; two modes of operation; and small form factor to enable portability.
