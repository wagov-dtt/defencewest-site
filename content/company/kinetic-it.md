## Capabilities

Kinetic IT aims to be recognised as a leader in technology solution, tailored to our clients and the environment in which they operate.

We are an Australian owned company that has many ties with defence and its IT needs throughout multiple contracts which place us in a unique position to support Defence IT capability, now and into the future.

Additionally, through our connections with the Veterans Community we are well placed to maximise the skills and qualifications of Defence Veterans and provide employment pathways, including entry level requiring no experience, that can assist with their transition to non defence related positions while still within the eco system
