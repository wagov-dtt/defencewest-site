## Overview

H-E Parts Engineering (HEPE) carries out machining works for the marine, mining, oil and gas and also rail industries. Established in 1989, we possess the experience and state of the art equipment to carry out superior work in a fast turnaround environment. We run two shifts to attend to the urgent nature of some of our work. HEPE has invested in some of the largest and most advanced equipment seen in WA, with another new building and larger machines still to come. We will have 100 tonne capacity in our next building. HEPE also has a robot-operated machine to keep us at the forefront of manufacturing. Our quality assured company is perfectly placed to play a big part in supporting the world's best defence projects.
## Capabilities

HEPE is unique because we have invested in the best quality high tech machines. Our operators are amongst the most highly skilled in Australia. We offer shift work to make sure projects are delivered on time. HEPE has very low staff turnover with many employees having served 20 years plus. We have been absorbing Lean Manufacturing procedures to reduce waste and streamline our operations. We can also adjust quickly to cope with unexpected breakdowns for our clients. HEPE has developed a custom scheduling system so customers can be well informed on how jobs are progressing. After more than 31 years of performing precision machining projects around Western Australia, we can take on most jobs.
