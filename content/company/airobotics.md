## Overview

Airobotics has developed a pilotless drone solution, the first of its kind in the global market. We provide an end-to-end, fully automatic solution (no human operator needed) for collecting aerial data and gaining invaluable insights.
Our industrial grade platform is available on-site and on-demand, enabling operations managers to access premium aerial data in a faster, safer and more efficient way compared to using manual methods involving ropes, scaffolding and manpower for data collection.
Airobotics
has developed a drone platform that is fully automated, and we are certified to fly commercial drones without a human operator.
## Capabilities

We empower industrial companies to leverage the power of drones without the need for skilled and expensive drone operators.
Customers can run missions to monitor, inspect, survey, and secure large industrial facilities in greater frequency and operational efficiency. Our unique platform features include multiple payloads and battery swapping capabilities using a robotic arm. This allows for a diversity of payloads and versatility in mission types.

The Airobotics platform automatically self-launches and lands with the click of a button. By taking the drone pilot and operator out of the equation, Airobotics removes the most expensive and hard to find component
of industrial drone operations. Our platform is durable and weather resistant and conforms to industrial grade standards. The Airbase is completely sealed, waterproof, and corrosion resistant. Drones are constructed on a rugged one-piece structure carrying various payloads.
