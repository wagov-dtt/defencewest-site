## Overview

West Coast Machining was started and built around the lack of high end, high tech CNC machining shops in WA, with this type of thinking WCMS has quickly become one of the leaders in WA for getting high tech, high end components made here in WA.
## Capabilities

West Coast Machining is very unique in WA due to the fact we think outside the square making us very innovated, but most of all we are very passionate about every aspect of our company. We can take your ideas through every stage of deployment and get your dreams turned into reality .
