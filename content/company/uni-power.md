## Overview

Uni-Power International manufactures 450 amp DC mobile diesel driven welder generators, 200 amp DC mobile engine
driven welder-generators, vehicle-mounted units that utilise engines as the generator's prime mover, high charge alternators and NATO 28V DC jet and turbo prop aircrafts.
## Capabilities

We are an Australian WA-based local company that specialises in manufacturing the Unipower 185 - a complete mobile power supply in a kit. The kit comprises a multi- purpose alternator, control module with remote hand throttle and cable and welding leads. The unit is automatically configured for 12V and 24V vehicle systems. It allows welding from the vehicle, produces a constant 240V or 110V power supply for all electronic hand tools, provides power for all types of lighting, provides fully regulated battery charging for 12V and 24V batteries of 200 Amps and 140 Amps and does not make a difference to the way a vehicle is driven.
