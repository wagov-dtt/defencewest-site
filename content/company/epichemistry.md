## Overview

Epichem is an Australian-owned contract research organisation established in 2003, providing synthetic and medicinal chemistry services to government, academic, and industry partners. From its foundation, Epichem has focused on delivering high-quality, reliable chemical R&D within Australia, supporting projects that require technical depth, confidentiality, and strong IP protection.

Although best known for work in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, Epichem's core capabilities--complex organic synthesis, materials and polymer chemistry, analytical characterisation, and bespoke reference materials--are directly applicable to defence and dual-use research programs. The company routinely operates under non-disclosure and collaboration agreements and is experienced in managing sensitive technical information.

Epichem maintains secure laboratory facilities in Western Australia and employs a highly skilled team of PhD-level and experienced chemists, enabling specialised work to be conducted domestically in line with Australian regulatory and funding requirements. With more than 20 years of operational history, Epichem is well positioned to support defence innovation by providing flexible, responsive chemistry capability that strengthens Australia's sovereign R&D capacity and industrial base.
## Capabilities

Epichem provides specialist chemistry capabilities that support defence and dual-use activities across force health protection, preparedness, sustainment, and capability development.

**Key capabilities include:**

- **Medicinal and applied chemistry** - analogue synthesis and SAR optimisation for antimicrobial and anti-infective programs.
- **Analytical chemistry and reference materials** - analytical method development, bespoke reference standards, degradation studies, and independent verification.
- **Materials and polymer chemistry** - functional and specialty materials, stability and compatibility studies for demanding environments.
- **Sustainment and obsolescence support** - chemistry input into material qualification, re-validation, and replacement of legacy chemical components.
- **Secure project delivery** - experience working under confidentiality and IP frameworks with sensitive technical data.

**Recent examples include:**

- **Supporting the Development of Antifouling compounds and AMR breakers** - Providing chemistry and synthesis support to local R&D company
- **Providing analytical and formulation support for the development of effective topical treatment for chronic ulcers** - with local R&D company commercializing the product with antimicrobial and biofilm disrupting technology.

Epichem offers a flexible, on-shore chemistry capability that complements Defence research organisations and prime contractors while strengthening Australia's sovereign capability.
