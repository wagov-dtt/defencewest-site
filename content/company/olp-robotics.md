## Overview

OLP Robotics is a unique and dynamic robotic integrator specialising in welding, thermal spray and laser systems automation, servicing local & interstate customers since 2013. Our team has successfully delivered projects for public higher education institutions, large enterprises as well as small to medium businesses. At OLP Robotics we are passionate about working closely with local businesses to deliver affordable process automation solutions, enabling genuine productivity gains, exceptional quality and reliability, and total operator safety. Our goal is to provide these services and products to manufacturing companies in the defence supply chain.
## Capabilities

With a strong background in welding we have developed key partnerships and expertise to deliver successful, high-quality cobot welding solutions tailored to the specific needs of our clients. Cobot welding is game-changing for the manufacturing industry, with extreme versatility, ease of use and affordability. Cobot welding is applicable to small and big business alike. We also focus on providing offline robot programming software sales and support, and use this as a tool for process simulation and validation, which is a powerful proof-of-concept tool. We have in-house CAD design expertise which we utilise to provide customised tool and jig design when required. Our goal is to be recognised as a complete solution provider enabling our customers to achieve successful robot implementations and boosting Australia's manufacturing capability.

Outside of these focus areas we are also experienced in traditional industrial automation and provide system design, installation and troubleshooting services across a range of makes and models of equipment.

OLP Robotics also has particular experience in robotic automation of thermal spray coating processes (HVOF / APS / TWAS) and can also assist with process qualification and quality assurance processes.
