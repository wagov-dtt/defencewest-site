## Overview

ASX-listed Carnegie Clean Energy Limited is focused on the development of solar energy, battery energy storage and wave energy technology. Since 1993, Carnegie has invested more than $130 million in the development of renewable energy technologies and projects. Carnegie is the 100% owner and developer of the CETO Wave Energy Technology intellectual property, and is also 100% owner of Energy Made Clean Pty Ltd (EMC). Named one of Australia's most innovative companies by the Australian Financial Review in 2016, EMC specialises in the delivery of mixed renewable energy projects that offer an end-to-end renewable energy solution, which are ideally suited to island, remote and fringe-of-grid applications. We are dedicated to in-house research and development, custom design, construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring of facilities across Australia.
## Capabilities

Within Australia, Carnegie delivers its solar energy and battery storage projects via a joint venture between EMC and Lendlease Services Pty Ltd. This integrated approach minimises risk in project delivery and reduces overall project costs, helping customers to navigate the transition to cleaner energy sources, and to safeguard energy assets for long term stability and reliability. In achieving military, utility and leading edge science engineering system outcomes, EMC offers an extensive range of robust battery energy storage solutions and has the expertise to customise and configure exact customer requirements and needs. Our systems are developed and delivered with the highest quality engineering capabilities and proven track record of success. Through Carnegie's and EMC's joint offerings, we are the only entities in the world to offer a combination of wave, solar, wind, storage and desalination via microgrids.
