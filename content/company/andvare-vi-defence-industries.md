## Overview

Andvare VI Defence Industries was established in 2019 to leverage the dual use applications of products our main company, Andvare Pty Ltd, had developed for the mining industry.  The initial focus was on Eastern Europe, where a subsidiary, Andvare Europe OOD, was established and had strong connections within the military contractors in that region. Due to restrictions during the pandemic, operations were returned to Australia and, at the urging of then Defence Minister Reynolds, we were in discussions with Hanwha Defence Australia in 2021 regarding supply of armour systems for the Land400 program.  Continuing interruptions to movement led the company to continue development of our products in isolation, resulting in our medium gauge Skjoldride® aluminium backed dual hardness armour line and our TYR-Flex and TYR-FR flexible soft armour and modular ballistic panels, which we took to LandForces24 as an Exhibitor on the Defence West stand.  Further research and engineering led to the development of our unique Thraex® special purpose alloy, which has substantial thermal and radio frequency camouflaging capabilities.  This product was first exhibited at Avalon2025, where we were again selected as an Exhibitor on the Defence West stand.  Owing to requests received from an Eastern European MOD to modify our modular ballistic panels to increase the survivability of ATV's in the Ukraine theatre, we continued to develop and improve our TYR-FR modular ballistic panels and were privileged to be able to showcase this product at London DSEI in September 2025 as part of the Team Defence Australia delegation.  As an extension to our survivability offering, we are working with security providers in the civilian and diplomatic fields to provide solutions for uparmouring civilian, NGO and thin skinned diplomatic vehicles with our TYR-FR modular ballistic panel solution.

## Capabilities

Specialising in the design, manufacture and supply of unique proprietary alloys and armour systems, ranging from heavy gauge AFV/IFV dual hardness armour systems and up armouring LV/ATV platforms, to man-portable, blast, fragmentation and rifle rated ballistic panels.  Via our proprietary Thraex® special purpose alloy, Andvare VI Defence Industries also provides unparalleled thermal and radio frequency camouflaging.  Further, through our Survivability initiative, initially emanating from the development of our TYR_FR modular ballistic panels, ADI have developed a rapid armour repair system, aimed specifically at returning battle damaged vehicle platforms to the field in significantly shorter turn-around times than currently experienced.  This capability was showcased at London DSEI 2025 and has been further discussed with Babcock, Thales and other PMV manufacturers and suppliers.  ADI's TYR_FR ballistic panels are currently being incorporated into a Global ATV manufacturer's primary product offering to military and police, as well as the paramilitary protection providers for NGO and Press security applications.

## Discriminators

1. Armour Systems
• Unique, extreme resistance armour systems for both vehicles and personnel
• Protection against high velocity antimateriel rounds (0.50 AP, 14.5x114 BZ API) with significant weight reduction (2.3x Mass
Efficiency v’s RHA)
• Lightweight – less than 50% thickness required for similar stopping ability of standard hard armour
• Able to be shaped and rolled
• Multi-hit - close grouping: strike face won’t fracture on impact
• Fully weldable for easy infield/battle repairs
• Ductile failure of rear face in the event of ballistic defeat eliminating backface spalling/shrapnel effect
• Aluminium backed Skjoldride® range uniquely designed for fixed wing and rotary aircraft protection cells
• Composite Skjoldride® solutions for light vehicle and ATV armour to provide ballistic protection without wholesale panel and
structural replacement
• Light weight, flexible and man-portable anti-fragmentation ballistic panels (TYR-FR range) are unique to the Industry,
providing protection against drone deployed munitions
• TYR-Flex range of soft armour is next to thinnest and lightest in class with negligible back face deformation per rated threat
  2. Thermal Camouflage & RF Attenuation
• Unique thermal signature attenuation and silhouette disruption
• Effective shielding of 4G LTE/5G, WIFI 6E, Bluetooth and L1 GPS signals and jamming
  3. Key Customers & Partners
     * Babcock
     * Polaris
     * NP Aerospace
     * Bulgarian Defence Institute
     * Terem Holdings OOD (Bulgaria)
     * Global Coating Solutions (Local WA Partner in rapid repair solution and Survivability delivery)
