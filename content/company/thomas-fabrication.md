## Overview

Thomas Fabrication commenced operations in Western Australia in 2013. Our family owned business was created out of a desire to provide superior cold-forming steel services in support of Western Australian industry. We specialise in millimetre-accurate Pressing, Rolling and Fabrication services in support of Mining, Civil, Defence and Oil & Gas clients.

We form all industrial metals, from common mild and stainless steels, hardened and impact resistant steels, through to rare and exotic alloys such as titanium (multiple grades) at industrial thicknesses. We provide market-superior flexibility in tooling and machine redundancy to ensure your project is completed on time, to the highest standards.
## Capabilities

Thomas Fabrication aims to be a partner of choice for Designers, Engineers and Contractors that require the initial manufacture and fabrication of robust intermediate metal goods from steel plate. Our primary differentiators within our industry lay with our universally compatible tooling, software and production processes, which provide critical redundancy for short lead-time items and within the multi-platform skills of our staff, who are qualified on our six press brakes and four plate rolling machines.

With overhead cranage and controllable access, our Bayswater forming workshop is designed to enable the rapid, safe and secure processing of multiple streams of steel material. Every piece of tooling and every machine setup can be applied to every one of our press brakes - enabling true optimisation of our production schedule based on our clients needs.

In essence, we provide critical redundancy in tools and talent to ensure that your project is completed on time and to the highest standards. When something goes wrong, the job still gets done, a rare capability in industrial manufacturing.
