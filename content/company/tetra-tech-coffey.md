## Overview

Coffey was established in 1959, and now operates as a professional services company with expertise in engineering, geoservices, environmental and project management. With a global footprint, we create value across the asset lifecycle in the oil and gas, power generation, mining, defence, government and transport industries providing customers with smarter solutions. In 2016, Coffey was acquired by US-based Tetra Tech Inc. Tetra Tech supports government and commercial customers through the provision of innovative solutions to complex problems focused on water, environment, energy, infrastructure, and natural resources.
## Capabilities

We have been delivering project management, engineering and environmental services to Defence for more than 23 years. Our business is structured to address the 2016 Defence White Paper, specifically its statement that "a high degree of interoperability with the United States is required to provide Australia with an effective deterrent," as well as Defence's statement that it intends to "enhance the ability for joint operations with the United States," including via the acquisition of interoperable weapons systems. Recent projects include: project management and environmental works relating to the new air combat capability; base engineering assessment programs (Stages 3-6); national airfields maintenance works at RAAF Bases Darwin, Townsville, Amberley and Williamtown; national airfields maintenance works at RAAF Bases Curtin, Tindal and Townsville; and space surveillance telescope works at Exmouth WA and New Mexico USA.
