## Overview

Established in Western Australia in 1978, Decmil is a leading Australian construction and engineering company providing services across a range of industry sectors. We are committed to outstanding project management and delivery regardless of the scale or the intricacy of the work. Decmil is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASX-listed company Decmil Group Limited. Our goal is to maximise returns from our operations by delivering value to our clients, shareholders and stakeholders. Decmil has a proud history of delivering projects with the Department of Defence, having delivered a wide range of projects at operating bases nationally. We have a demonstrated ability in delivering sensitive, remote, secure and technically-challenging projects. Our defence experience has included accommodation, fuel infrastructure, training area infrastructure upgrades, building and hangar upgrades, water infrastructure, roads and urban operations training facilities. These projects have been delivered under multiple contract arrangements, including managing contractor, design and construct and construct only.
## Capabilities

Our diverse experience, flexible approach and integrated construction and engineering capability ensures we respond appropriately and efficiently to our Clients' needs and add value no matter the stage of the project life cycle. Our design management capability is supported by our costing and planning experts, giving us the technical ability to develop fully costed, value-engineered designs to deliver greater quality, time and cost certainty throughout construction with a focus on whole of life considerations. We work collaboratively with design firms to understand their technology and preferred delivery concepts and techniques to optimise the design, ensuring a seamless and integrated approach to construction. We pride ourselves on delivering solutions that provide the Client and end users with a more suitable, more functional or more reliable facility than previously envisaged.
