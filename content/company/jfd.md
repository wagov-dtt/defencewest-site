## Overview

JFD Australia is the Australian subsidiary of UK company JFD, and provides world leading undersea products, systems and capabilities to the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Commercial offshore sector. At its core JFD Australia is the proven and reliable contracted capability in the provision of Submarine Rescue Services to the Australian Submarine Force and is at the ready to respond to the RAN's call out in the event of a submarine incident. Although a fully contractor operated service and capability, when deployed JFD Australia forms up under the ADF's Command and Control structure for a submarine rescue operation. This service also includes the delivery of Submarine Abandonment & Escape Rescue training for our active Australian submariners. Additionally JFD Australia supports the ADF with specialist diving equipment and systems including diver treatment chambers for our special undersea warfighters and RAN Clearance Divers. For our commercial clients including Police Forces, we provide product sales in support of their diving or diving tender operations.

## Capabilities

JFD Australia is unique in this undersea sector for two specific reasons. Firstly a key differentiator in this undersea Defence market is the ability for the synergies in our products and systems in the very different applications of submarine rescue to special diving operations to diver treatment support being able to be threaded together to provide a very unique one-stop capability partner service. Secondly as JFD Australia is part of a global company specializing in these sectors, the ability to reach for support, intelligence, development and competent personnel to supplement local resources is a key point of differentiation and allows the company to provide depth and reach in support of our clients; this is true in both the delivery of enhanced or new equipment, and the direct support of existing systems for the mission-critical operations of our client organisations.
