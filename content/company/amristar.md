## Overview

Founded in 1999, Amristar has over 15 years of experience and a strong track record of successfully delivering the most challenging projects to a solid portfolio of long-term customers including business and several WA Government agencies. Headquartered in Perth, our team of ICT and software engineering professionals helps organisations develop IT strategy, architect effective technology systems and build high-quality, cloud scale business applications. We write software, most often web applications, with specialties in enterprise workflow systems, mapping and geospatial, digital integration and cloud services.
In addition to bespoke customer-oriented consulting services, we develop a range of web mapping products which help customers to source data from anywhere and deliver high-fidelity location-intelligent web maps.
## Capabilities

Armistar is unique within the Australian ICT landscape, with an offering that spans business solutions, software development and specialist geospatial capability. We are highly experienced in both on-premise and cloud/ Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment, with capability to support all cloud providers, but specialising in Amazon, AWS and Azure. Our initial product, iDelve, was the first to utilise vector streaming on a web platform. Our newest web mapping product, Mapworks - available on-premise or as a fully SaaS solution - is a go-to platform for enterprises and application developers who seek excellence in web maps, spatial data management and location intelligence/analytics. Our web mapping products have delivered commercial success across a range of customers and projects. In particular, we have built a strong reputation as geospatial experts able to bridge the gap between IT and geospatial information systems. We can demonstrate a track record in the delivery, maintenance and support of resilient, sustainable solutions that stand the test of time.
