capabilities: "Our aim at Multiplan is to be seen as the solution, stopping potential issues in their track, all while adding constructability insights, production intelligence and skilled resourcing along the way.\n\nOur Direct Client Engagement (DCE™) model is the next evolution of the project client - detailer relationship and, our Direct Fabricator Engagement (DFE™) model has always been a traditional part of our industry.\n\nExpertise\n\nWe're the all-important link between project teams, their builder, engineers, and architects, and the steel fabrication process, we translate ideas from engineering into fully-resolved digital construction models and millimetre-perfect shop drawings - right down to the last steel beam, plate and bolt.\n\nSpotting issues before they arise is a key part of our role. We add innovation and value through early engagement and efficient scheduling. Our experienced, expert team has an unbeatable track record in finishing on time and on budget. We forge proactive,\
  \ reliable project partnerships to deliver industry-leading solutions on mega projects.\n\nWhether it is early engagement with designers or visualising construction from completed documentation, our modelling drives time and cost efficiencies, mitigates risk and delivers invaluable data and insights.\n\nWorking directly with engineering teams to produce detailed 3D construction models enables us to raise and address technical queries early on in the process, preventing costly downstream changes and delays, and ensuring a seamless transition to fabrication.  \n  \nOur 3D digital models and skilled resourcing add constructability insights and production intelligence to every project we work on.\n\nAt Multiplan, agile project management has become part of our everyday, helping us work quickly and collaboratively, on budget and to deadline, as we translate ideas into the precision-perfect steel drawings fabricators rely on.\n\nFeedback can be acted on quickly and responsive changes made so\
  \ that projects proceed accurately and efficiently.\n\nSeamless workflows, work packs and modules are designed to suit both workshop capacity and project schedules.\n\nIntegrated reporting follows the entire process, from material purchase through to assembly and erection."
