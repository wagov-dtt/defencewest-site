  Austral Ships Pty Ltd (Structural - Marine) - $12million value

  Over the years we have seen Austal Ships grow from a small group of dedicated shareholder employees into one of the best large aluminium fast vessel designers/constructors in the world.


  With every expansion, we were involved both with the design and construction/management of their new facilities.


  Cash strapped because of growth, Austal demanded and expected cost efficient large steel structures to manufacture a wide range of large aluminium catamarans and ferries.'
