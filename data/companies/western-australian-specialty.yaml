overview: 'Western Australian Speciality Alloys (WASA) operates specialist melting and forging facilities at sites in Perth, Western Australia and Albury, New South Wales.


  WASA first opened its doors in Canning Vale, Western Australia in 1993 and over the next decade, established strategic customer relationships with Pratt & Whitney (1995), Rolls Royce (1999) and GE Aviation (2000).


  WASA started its F-35 journey by becoming qualified for the melting of the powder alloy IN100 for Pratt & Whitney in 1998. WASA now supplies half of the master remelt IN100 for the F-135 engine globally. IN100 is a critical alloy used in engine disc manufacture for the F-35, and WASA has supplied this material to Pratt & Whitney continuously since inception. WASA also supplies ME16 ingot for the powder atomisation process used to produce critical components for the Pratt & Whitney F-135 engine.


  In early 2002, Precision Castparts Corporation (PCC) acquired the balance of independent WASA shareholdings. The acquisition of WASA by PCC complemented its own strategy of a vertically integrated supply chain whereby the PCC group facilities manufacture all critical jet engine components. WASA''s ability to manufacture rotating grade alloys gave PCC the opportunity to increase alloy sales to engine primes.


  As part of the PCC strategy, Overall Forge near Albury, New South Wales, was acquired by PCC. WASA has since taken over the management and transition of Overall Forge into the supply chain of PCC globally.


  As a super alloy production company, WASA is part of the critical supply chain for its customers who, in turn, directly support Defence capability worldwide. WASA''s melting capabilities have ensured that military propulsion systems developed by engine manufactures are able to meet the challenging demands of their customers.'

capabilities: 'Double vacuum melted VIM & VAR and VIM & ESR ingots are produced in solid solution strengthened nickel base and precipitation hardened Superalloys, Maraging and PH stainless steels. Triple melted VIM/ESR/VAR alloys are also produced for premium rotating applications.


  VIM remelt Superalloy barstock is a major product line, produced in a range of sizes for investment casting and powder applications.


  Our fully integrated facility covers the forging process from raw material receipts through to finished bar and near shape sizes. All production including sawing, forging, heat treatment, machining, testing and certification is done in-house.


  We are the only vacuum induction melting facility of its kind in the southern hemisphere. As such, we aim to provide the highest quality alloys for the most stringent physical applications.'
