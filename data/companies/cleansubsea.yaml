overview: 'CleanSubSea is an Australian company that has developed the innovative, diver driven or remotely operated Envirocart System, a **world-first completely closed in-water hull cleaning system** with biofouling removal, capture,  containment and filtration (meaning no collected marine growth enters the ocean). It includes a subsea cleaning system with interchangeable blades for cleaning bio-fouling from ships hulls, without damaging paint and eliminates polluting the surrounding marine environment during the cleaning operation. The captured effluent is pumped to the surface, filtered through a multistage treatment system that removes marine growth, particulates and metal toxins from the AFC, and clean water is then returned to the sea.


  This process will also save money through reduced fuel costs but more importantly has a very positive environmental impact, in less fuel consumed and a contribution towards net zero targets by significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.'

capabilities: 'CleanSubSea''s Envirocart includes a subsea cleaning system with interchangeable blades for cleaning bio-fouling from submerged steel surfaces with biocidal and non-biocidal Anti Fouling Coating (AFC). Using nonabrasive technology, the system does not damage the AFC and eliminates polluting the surrounding marine environment during the cleaning operation. The captured effluent is pumped to the surface, filtered through a multistage treatment system that removes marine growth, particulates and metal toxins from the AFC, and clean water is then returned to the sea.


  The Envirocart system also includes diver hand tools for cleaning niche areas, sea chests and propeller polishing, whilst still maintaining full capture, containment and filtration.


  The use of this equipment on Australian Naval vessels will allow them to remain in a constant state of readiness to mobilise and operate at maximum speed and efficiency.


  CleanSubSea has previously conducted successful early stage trials with the RAN, and are also working on research projects to apply this technology to submarines. Based in western Australia, CleanSubSea is ideally suited to support the vessels being introduced under the Sea-3000 program.


  CleanSubSea is in communication with the Director of the RAN''s Regional Maintenance Centre - West, who have confirmed strong interest in engaging an Envirocart system once it''s capabilities can be fully demonstrated. CleanSubSea is also in discussions with one of the key ADF "primes" that operate both in Australia and UK, who have expressed an interest in being the Envirocart operator in both locations to support RAN and UK Navy.'
discriminators: "Through the implementation of a global network of Envirocart systems and the hull cleaning services this will offer, marine growth can be removed from the hulls of ships, in the water, without costly and time consuming dry docking but doing so in a very environmentally protective manner. Removing marine growth reduces the fuel consumption of a vessel, and eliminates the potential for spreading unwanted/alien \"invasive marine species\" into Australia's waters or into other marine ecosystems internationally. This process will also save money through reduced fuel costs but more importantly have a very positive environmental impact, in less fuel consumed and a contribution towards net zero targets by significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.\n\n  * IMO/BIMCO accreditation through Lloyd's Register pending in 2025."
