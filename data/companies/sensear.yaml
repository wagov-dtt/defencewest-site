capabilities: 'Sensear’s design, development, manufacturing, and service facility located in Perth, Western Australia, has been at the fore-front of innovation since 2006. From the outset Sensear’s objective was very simple: to enable people working in high noise environments to talk without having to remove their headphones or earplugs. Today, Sensear’s range of over-the-ear and in-ear products use SENS®, the same core patented technology as used in its very first product 15 years ago. SENS® (Speech Enhancement, Noise Suppression) technology combines multiple highly directive microphones and unique software algorithms to enhance speech whilst suppressing harmful ambient noise. As a global exporter of Hearing Protection Communication Headsets, Sensear mandatorily complies with the highest standards of conformity set by internationally recognised testing, certification, and research companies.'
