capabilities: "We empower industrial companies to leverage the power of drones without the need for skilled and expensive drone operators. Customers can run missions to monitor, inspect, survey, and secure large industrial facilities in greater frequency and operational efficiency. Our unique platform features include multiple payloads and battery swapping capabilities using a robotic arm. This allows for a diversity of payloads and versatility in mission types.   \n  \nThe Airobotics platform automatically self-launches and lands with the click of a button. By taking the drone pilot and operator out of the equation, Airobotics removes the most expensive and hard to find component of industrial drone operations. Our platform is durable and weather resistant and conforms to industrial grade standards. The Airbase is completely sealed, waterproof, and corrosion resistant. Drones are constructed on a rugged one-piece structure carrying various payloads."
