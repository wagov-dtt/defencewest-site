capabilities: In WA, ASC maintains its own facilities adjacent to the Common User Facility at Henderson to support the Collins-class submarine fleet. In 2003 we commenced a 25-year contract to undertake the ongoing repair, maintenance and design upgrades of the submarines. This through-life support contract was replaced by the current In-Service Support Contract (ISSC) in mid-2012. ASC maintains a highly-skilled workforce in the West that currently undertakes up to mid-cycle dockings for submarines in WA
