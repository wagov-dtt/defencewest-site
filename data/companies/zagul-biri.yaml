overview: 'Zagul Biri is a First Nations–led advisory and engagement company supporting Defence and Defence industry organisations operating in Western Australia. The company assists industry to navigate complex cultural, workforce, and stakeholder environments while delivering practical, Defence-aligned outcomes.


  The name _Zagul_ refers to bioluminescent light that reveals what is otherwise unseen, while _Biri_ represents fire — clarity, purpose, and responsibility. Together, Zagul Biri reflects the company’s role in providing insight and guidance in complex operating environments.


  Zagul Biri is led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander directors with lived Defence experience, including long-serving Royal Australian Navy backgrounds, senior leadership roles, and extensive engagement across Defence, government, industry, and First Nations organisations. This background provides a strong understanding of Defence culture, governance, and operational expectations.


  The company brings decades of collective experience supporting Indigenous workforce participation, cultural capability, and stakeholder engagement within highly regulated environments. Zagul Biri works with Defence primes, SMEs, and government stakeholders to support initiatives aligned with Defence priorities, including workforce development, social procurement, and Indigenous engagement.


  Zagul Biri actively engages with Defence West, Aboriginal business hubs, and industry partners to align its services with Western Australia’s Defence industry priorities and to contribute to sustainable economic participation, workforce capability, and long-term industry growth.'
