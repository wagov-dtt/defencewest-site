overview: "Thornton Tomasetti Pty Ltd is headquartered in Perth and has been working in the Energy sector in AUS for a decade and Defence sector for 4 years. Within both sectors we specialise in conducting advanced analysis of extreme loading events (shock, blast, fire, seismic, etc..) as well as testing which currently focuses on Defence. We operate our own naval shock test machine (JASSO) to qualify equipment for use on Defence platforms as well as operating the heavyweight shock barge on behalf of Defence at their underwater explosive test facility. We have extensive advanced analysis and software development capabilities which when combined with the testing enables us to provide a holistic service to clients, supporting them at any stage of the design and/or qualification process.   \n  \nThornton Tomasetti has built a team of highly experienced engineers and scientists across Australia with extensive experience directly supporting several ADF projects. Thornton Tomasetti will continue\
  \ to build this expertise and provide specialist Naval platform survivability, Land platform survivability, Explosive Safety, Facility protection design, Engineering and testing services. The team consists of members who have decades of combined expertise working with DSTG and the RAN in high risk/high consequence areas as well as specialised expertise in T&E, advanced analysis (CFD/FEA) and software development. \n\nIn addition to our direct defence support capabilities, the Australian team also has significant experience supporting high risk industries, decarbonisation, safety and risk management, future fuels (including battery analysis) and Protective Design and Security (Security Risk assessments, Heavy Vehicle Mitigation and structural blast assessments).    \n  \nIn addition, Thornton Tomasetti is part of a global company, including with over 50 years experience supporting the US DoD and over 25 years supporting the UK MoD."
