slug: directions-workforce
overview: Directions Workforce Solutions has built a strong, practical history of supporting Australia’s defence industry by designing and delivering tailored apprenticeship, pre-apprenticeship and Group Training Organisation programs that supply job-ready talent to the defence supply chain. From our earliest partnerships with local defence contractors, we’ve focused on compliance, safety and quality standards, matching training outcomes to contract requirements and on-site technical needs. Our end-to-end approach — candidate attraction and selection, payroll and administration, mentoring, workplace supervision and employer engagement — reduces onboarding risk and accelerates productivity for suppliers. We actively grow diverse pipelines through initiatives such as the Women in Defence Industry Scholarship, school and community outreach, and targeted recruitment for hard-to-fill trades. Our commitment is proven by award-winning apprentices who have progressed into defence roles, including
  various award-winning finalists, demonstrating the caliber of talent we develop. With scalable, locally grounded programs and deep industry relationships, Directions is a trusted partner for defence contractors seeking skilled, sustainable workforce solutions now and into the future.

capabilities: 'Directions Workforce Solutions combines specialist Group Training Organisation capability with hands-on recruitment, compliance, payroll and apprentice mentoring to deliver workforce outcomes tailored to the defence supply chain. We design defence-aligned training pathways that map to contract requirements, safety regimes and technical standards; manage end-to-end onboarding (candidate attraction, selection, payroll, workplace supervision and reporting); and maintain intentionally low caseloads to provide highly personalised support and rapid problem-solving for employers.


  Recent examples include:

  • Award-Winning Placements — supported AENWA finalists and Special Recognition winners into roles within defence contractors, demonstrating our ability to develop high-calibre, job-ready technicians.

  • Tailored GTO delivery for Local Defence Suppliers — implemented customised on-the-job training plans, compliance checklists and mentor rosters while managing payroll and performance reporting, reducing employer administrative burden and accelerating apprentice productivity.

  • School and Community Engagement — ran targeted campaigns with our Apprentice Advisors to attract motivated candidates for hard-to-fill trades, connecting industry needs with local training providers.


  Together these capabilities provide defence contractors with a compliant, scalable and locally grounded workforce solution that lowers hiring risk, supports diversity targets and produces technicians ready for the unique demands of defence projects.'
