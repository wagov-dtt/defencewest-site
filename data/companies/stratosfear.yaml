name: Stratosfear
slug: stratosfear
overview: 'Stratosfear is a fully-integrated finance, strategic management and corporate advisory firm, established in 2008 and purpose-built to support companies facing rapid scale, complex structure and growth demands. We specialise in delivering resilient, growth-ready organisations by blending capital advisory, strategic management and operational execution into one end-to-end service offering.


  We have deep experience in high-growth sectors such as surf-wear and mining services (where year-on-year growth frequently exceeded 50 %) and bring that same intensity of financial rigour and strategic clarity to clients. Stratosfear’s world-class capabilities in working-capital and capital-structure analysis – combined with our established networks in Western Australia and interstate – mean we’re uniquely positioned to support defence-oriented enterprises.


  Many defence suppliers face customer-concentration risk, stringent compliance regimes, heightened ESG expectations and limited access to tailored capital. We’ve worked with businesses in the defence sector previously in roles including capital-structure optimisation, working-capital improvement and strategic planning.


  At Stratosfear we work in two modes: “guide” – instructing and empowering management teams – or “drive & do” – hands-on execution. Our approach is designed to augment and strengthen executive teams that may be stretched beyond their current operational, financial or strategic capacity.


  Our goal is simple: to help create strong, stable, scalable enterprises that are positioned for long-term success in the defence ecosystem. We welcome the opportunity to support WA and national defence industry businesses in navigating growth, complexity and competitive advantage.'
