capabilities: We are truly unique. Our business model is based upon long-term services, rather than simply providing contract resources from the local market to satisfy demand. We invest heavily in our own IP, solutions, products, and services. PinnacleQM has been recognised as a leader in agile delivery (CIO Outlook Magazine - March 2017) and for our Smarter Transportation and Autonomous Vehicles research (CIO Review Magazine - August 2017). We continue to develop out-of-the-box solutions and services for our customers. We are a supplier-partner to Lurssen with respect to the OPVs and are developing relationships with other companies supplying into the Future Submarine and Air and Missile defence projects.
