overview: Aurora Labs Limited (Aurora) is a developer of metal 3D printing, or Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology based in Perth, Western Australia. The Company was founded in 2014, listed in 2016 on the ASX, and since then has progressed its core suite of 3D printing technologies, specialising in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) printing of metals. Aurora also offers printing and associated research project services to local clients and industry partners. Aurora's technology significantly lowers the cost of printing, to a point at which it becomes cost effective to utilise for many of the industrial applications that have used a combination of casting, forging and subtractive forms of manufacturing.
