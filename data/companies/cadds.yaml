overview: 'Established in 1993, CADDS Group is a Western Australian multidisciplinary organisation delivering integrated engineering, design, surveying, sustainability, digital, and fabrication services across industrial, commercial and Defence environments. Over 30 years, we have grown into a sovereign capability provider with operations in Henderson, Perth CBD, Bibra Lake, Karratha, and Melbourne. Our values Safety, Intelligence, Integrity, Inclusivity, and Collaboration guide all project delivery.


  Our capabilities span engineering design (all disciplines), building and product design, drafting and drawing conversion, surveying and 3D scanning, engineering data management, conveyor and machine guarding, project management, document control, quality assurance, sustainability consulting, 3D printing (metals/composites), animation, shop detailing, and in-house fabrication. This integrated structure enables CADDS to provide full lifecycle solutions, from concept design to digital engineering, prototyping, fabrication, documentation, and construction support.


  CADDS maintains ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 45001 certifications, ensuring high-quality, safe, and environmentally compliant delivery aligned with Defence requirements. Our Henderson presence near the Australian Marine Complex positions us to support Defence maritime and estate projects efficiently.


  Recent Defence work includes the **Robertson Barracks Kennel Refurbishment** , where we delivered architectural design, documentation, engineering input, and construction support, and the **Defence Force - Cocos (Keeling) Islands facility upgrades** , providing architectural, engineering, and certification services for remote operational conditions.


  CADDS Group continues to expand its sovereign capability through digital engineering, scanning, sustainability, and fabrication capacity, positioning us as a trusted partner to Defence agencies and primes seeking integrated, reliable, and technically robust project solutions.'
