slug: 4z
overview: 'We are an Australian leader in the development and delivery of 3D laser scanning, inspection and metrology services.

  Opening our first office in 2012, we have been one of the pioneering companies of 3D industrial laser scanning services in this country.

  We have redefined asset reliability and materials management through the

  use of high definition,

  three-dimensional data sets.

  4Z is committed to provide the most accurate 3D data for high level modelling and analysis of any structure or component.

  We guarantee accuracy, precision and portability of digital 3D data for you, using terrestrial laser scanners, metrology grade laser scanners, portable CMMs, drones/UAVs and laser trackers.

  Working across a range of industry sectors, including oil and gas, power generation, mining, engineering and construction, means we are quick to adapt to your requirements, and can provide highly skilled technicians to access and gather data in

  any environment -- we are difficult-access professionals. At 4Z we can work from ropes, EWP, inside confined spaces and in major hazard facilities.
