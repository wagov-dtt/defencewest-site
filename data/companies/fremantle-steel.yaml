capabilities: We offer the latest technology in advanced manufacturing processes and project controls. Our beam manufacturing facility has unique capacities, including the ability to produce beams with a web depth up to 4 metres in height, and lengths of up to 30 metres across all major steel grades. Our Computer Numeric Control (CNC) laser pipe and tube processing line can cut with extremely high precision - up to 610 millimeters diameter pipe and 500 millimeters square tube. Project control competencies include the development of a 4D capability by combining our 3D Navisworks and Primavera P6 programs for project progress analysis. Having the ability to see a sequence of events depicted on a timeline enables us to quickly determine the required optimal solution with regard to effectively utilising labour, materials and time variables across a project.
