capabilities: 'Decem are specialists in the areas of defence-focused project management, supply chain management, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), and engineering. Project Management: Decem has the capability to support ASDEFCON tender development, project/program delivery and CDRL development in both the acquisition and support (In-Service and Disposal) stages of the capability lifecycle. Our extensive maritime experience in both operations and sustainment, as well as commercial maritime industry experience allows the team to deliver program objectives in the most complex of situations. We bring an in-depth understanding of the way Navy and Defence manage maritime assets, coupled with best practice from the commercial and offshore marine sectors to achieve your program objectives. Supply Chain: Our people have the capability to conduct supply chain and asset management operations, focusing on codified European spares specific to the LHD and LSD Classes. Decem supports Navy, CASG and
  Defence industry by supplying difficult to source codified items in a timely manner. Furthermore, Decem actively seeks to Australianise the supply chain for items that can be efficiently manufactured in Australia. This long-term approach brings benefits to our Australian industry partners while reducing lead times through a less complex supply chain. Integrated Logistic Support: As ILS subject matter experts, we provide the niche capability to produce, update and validate Assembly Parts Lists (APL) and Outfit Allowance Lists (OAL) using the APLCrates application. Decem''s experts are well versed in utilising existing data sources, such as recommended provisioning lists and codification data lists to produce an APL quickly and accurately. Where data is missing or incomplete, we can research and communicate with stakeholders to obtain and determine suitable requirements. We can conduct APL creation and updates at both the project and class level and have extensive experience in ensuring
  that all Navy requirements are met. We can complete smaller APL and Navy validation tasks and are adept at investigating a variety of information sources when minimal information is initially available. With an intimate understanding of CASG logistics processes and procedures required to support maritime capability, we are a sensible partner for ILS activities. Engineering: Decem have extensive engineering expertise within the team and access to specialist maritime engineering skills to supplement our capability. We can support specific marine engineering activity including design reviews, stability assessments and review rolling hull surveys. Our capability includes naval architecture and marine survey activities with a sound understanding of the challenges associated with the integration of complex systems in the maritime environment. We are available to support engineering efforts from the requirements, through the design, fabrication, and installation all the way to the V&V and completion
  activities. Our rigorous approach to documentation and maintaining good engineering process will support your organisations engineering efforts.'
