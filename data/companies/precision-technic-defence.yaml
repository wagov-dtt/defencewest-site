capabilities: We differentiate ourselves from other companies by building relationships with the end-users, acquisition teams, commanders and industry partners to bring together complete capability solutions. We are not a shopfront for disparate pieces of equipment. We seek to engineer capability solutions customised to the requirements of individual mission sets. We complete capability delivery through training, supply, support, advice on organisational requirements, facilities and contracting of personnel where ever in the world it is required.
