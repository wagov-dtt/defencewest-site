slug: epichemistry
overview: 'Epichem is an Australian-owned contract research organisation established in 2003, providing synthetic and medicinal chemistry services to government, academic, and industry partners. From its foundation, Epichem has focused on delivering high-quality, reliable chemical R&D within Australia, supporting projects that require technical depth, confidentiality, and strong IP protection.


  Although best known for work in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, Epichem’s core capabilities—complex organic synthesis, materials and polymer chemistry, analytical characterisation, and bespoke reference materials—are directly applicable to defence and dual-use research programs. The company routinely operates under non-disclosure and collaboration agreements and is experienced in managing sensitive technical information.


  Epichem maintains secure laboratory facilities in Western Australia and employs a highly skilled team of PhD-level and experienced chemists, enabling specialised work to be conducted domestically in line with Australian regulatory and funding requirements. With more than 20 years of operational history, Epichem is well positioned to support defence innovation by providing flexible, responsive chemistry capability that strengthens Australia’s sovereign R&D capacity and industrial base.'
