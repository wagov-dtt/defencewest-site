overview: Nauti-Craft Pty Ltd is a research and development company focused on the design and development of the patented Nauti-Craft marine suspension system. This technology separates a vessel’s hull from the deck and superstructure via a ‘passive reactive’ interlinked hydraulic system to realise increased levels of ride comfort, control and stability. Our technology eliminates buffeting in even modest wave conditions by reducing whole body vibration by up to 75%, thus providing unparalleled levels of shock mitigation. Improvements to stability and the maintenance of a level attitude can be further enhanced with active control of the suspension system including deck attitude and active cornering control. Our technology has great potential application for commercial, military and recreational vessels.

capabilities: 'We are a flexible style research and development company with a small highly experienced team of engineers, technicians and naval architects who specialise in taking radical new concepts from proof-of-concept stage to commercially viable prototypes. We have a growing Intellectual Property (IP) portfolio comprising five international patent families dating back to 2002. Nauti-Craft’s technology solves buffeting issues in marine vessels thanks to the inventor/founder Chris Heyring and other core team members that developed automotive suspension technology company, Kinetic Pty Ltd. Nauti-Craft suspension technology provides: improved crew and passenger comfort; reduced health risk from exposure to whole body vibration; a wider operating window in adverse weather conditions; safer transfer to a dock or other vessel; improved handling and maneuverability; and a competitive advantage and unique selling proposition.'
