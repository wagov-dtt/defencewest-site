overview: 'Greenroom Robotics is an Australian deep-tech company pioneering advanced maritime autonomy software. Since 2018, Greenroom has supported defence and national security outcomes by providing maritime control systems, AI/ML-enabled situational awareness, and digital infrastructure for autonomous and uncrewed surface vessels (USVs).


  Our flagship product, GAMA, enables COLREGS-compliant autonomous navigation across diverse vessel types, while Lookout+ enhances detection and classification of surface threats using real-time vision-based perception. These systems have been deployed in support of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and other international naval clients through operational sea trials, research collaborations, and commercial demonstrations.


  Greenroom operates at the intersection of software, autonomy, and naval innovation—delivering sovereign capabilities that enhance warfighter safety, reduce crew burden, and modernise fleet operations. As a trusted dual-use supplier, Greenroom is actively engaged in AUKUS Pillar II, contributing to allied innovation in unmanned maritime systems.'
