capabilities: Together with extensive offshore experience, our engineering capability enables us to provide innovative engineering solutions that push the boundaries of remote intervention. We combine traditional engineering calculations, industry leading engineering software products and our proprietary subsea simulation software – DeepworksTM - to provide comprehensive design solutions. This allows proposed design solutions to be simulated, trialled and demonstrated before any commitment to manufacturing. 3D models of our designs are imported into the simulation software which allows engineers or ROV pilots to fly and operate the design and highlight any areas for improvement. Utilising this capability early in the design phase allows us to optimise designs, thus increasing confidence in the viability of a proposed solution. This factor is invaluable in securing budgets and management buy-in for proposed projects.
