capabilities: 'Iconic Water Solutions delivers capabilities that align with the needs of the defence industry, particularly in water security, infrastructure resilience, environmental compliance, and remote-site operability. Our core capabilities include the design, fabrication, commissioning and servicing of modular water and wastewater treatment systems engineered for reliability, rapid deployment and seamless integration with existing infrastructure.


  These systems can be configured for potable water production, wastewater treatment, water recycling, chemical dosing, and environmental discharge compliance—functions commonly required across defence bases, training areas, and mobile operations. Our modular approach minimises installation time, reduces site disruption and provides predictable performance in variable or austere conditions.


  Iconic’s engineering capability spans mechanical, electrical, instrumentation and controls, enabling us to deliver integrated solutions supported by long-term service, remote monitoring and asset-management plans. Our team works within strict safety, regulatory and quality frameworks, ensuring compliance with environmental, OHSE and water-quality standards relevant to defence settings.


  While Iconic has not yet delivered work directly for defence, our capabilities have been applied across similar high-compliance and operationally demanding environments. Recent projects include modular wastewater treatment solutions for remote industrial sites, reverse osmosis and filtration packages for regional facilities, and ongoing servicing of critical water infrastructure. These projects demonstrate our ability to deliver reliable, compliant and resilient systems suitable for defence applications.


  Iconic is well positioned to support defence contractors and government agencies seeking robust water infrastructure solutions where reliability, mobility and compliance are essential.'
