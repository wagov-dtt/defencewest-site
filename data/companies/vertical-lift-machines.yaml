overview: 'Vertical Lift Machines (VLM) is a Western Australian owned company and the exclusive Australasian distributor of Dalmec Industrial Manipulators. Founded in 2015 and headquartered in Perth, VLM supplies advanced pneumatic lifting systems that improve safety, precision and efficiency across defence and industry.


  Our background is in providing specialised material handling solutions to manufacturing, warehousing and industrial clients through the distribution of premium European equipment. Building on this experience, VLM has expanded its focus to include defence, where the same need for safe, precise and reliable handling is critical. We are a registered defence supplier and have recently secured an order supporting Army Aviation through the introduction of the new Apache helicopter program.


  Dalmec manipulators provide near weightless, highly controlled movement of components, assemblies and tooling. Their fully pneumatic design contains no electronics, sensors or motors, making them reliable, low maintenance and well suited to the demanding conditions found in defence facilities. The precision of the system also allows operators to position and assemble components with tight tolerances, improving workflow consistency and reducing physical strain on personnel.


  Across Australia and New Zealand, Dalmec has more than 650 installed systems, many of which have been operating reliably for close to 30 years. This long service life demonstrates the strength of the design and the value it provides to organisations that require safe and dependable handling solutions.


  VLM is committed to supporting the growth of Australia’s sovereign industrial capability. By providing technology that protects workers, enhances precision and strengthens operational performance, we aim to contribute meaningfully to the defence manufacturing, maintenance and sustainment sectors across Western Australia and beyond.'

capabilities: 'Vertical Lift Machines (VLM) provides advanced pneumatic lifting and handling systems that improve safety, precision and workflow efficiency across defence manufacturing, maintenance and sustainment activities. Our capabilities support environments where accuracy, repeatability and workforce protection are essential.


  Our Dalmec manipulators enable operators to move, position and assemble components in near weightless conditions. This allows personnel to handle awkward or heavy parts without strain while maintaining precise control for tasks that require small tolerances. The fully pneumatic design contains no electronics, motors or hydraulics, making the systems reliable, low maintenance and ideal for shipyards, aviation facilities and sensitive defence sites.


  VLM offers full life cycle capability including requirement assessment, custom engineering, installation, commissioning, operator training and ongoing technical support. Our Perth based team provides fast response times and direct access to decision makers.


  We have recently applied these capabilities within the defence industry by supplying manipulators to support **Army Aviation’s introduction of the new Apache helicopter program**. The systems allow maintenance personnel to safely handle key components and assemblies with consistent precision, reducing physical strain and improving workflow reliability. This example demonstrates how pneumatic manipulators can directly support defence readiness by protecting the workforce and improving operational efficiency.


  VLM is committed to supporting Australia’s sovereign industrial capability through safe, reliable and precise material handling solutions tailored to defence environments.'
