capabilities: 'At **CX** , we’re redefining how defence forces see, manage, and control complex and high-risk operations — in real time, across any theatre of operation.


  Our plug-and-play computer vision AI transforms any military worksite — from a forward operating base to a defence logistics hub or naval vessel — into a persistent, real-time digital twin. Much like a next-generation command dashboard, it provides a live 3D operational picture, automatically identifying unsafe conditions, people, equipment, potential collisions, equipment hazards, and mission-critical deviations. When a threat or risk is detected, the system issues instant visual and audio alerts in the field, while simultaneously notifying commanders and remote decision-makers. The result: enhanced situational awareness, reduced incidents, faster responses, and improved force protection.


  Our second product line enables **global remote operations from a single, deployable case**. Using our ruggedised, pelican-sized system, operators can establish a secure link to our remote operations centre in under five minutes and take positive control of ROVs, UAVs, and autonomous or tele-operated robotic systems anywhere in the world. It’s hardened, fast, and designed for contested, degraded, and austere environments.


  Together, these technologies provide defence leaders with full operational visibility, heightened safety, and true remote capability — bridging the gap between the physical battlespace and the digital command environment, and giving forces a decisive operational advantage.'
