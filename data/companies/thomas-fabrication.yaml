capabilities: "Thomas Fabrication aims to be a partner of choice for Designers, Engineers and Contractors that require the initial manufacture and fabrication of robust intermediate metal goods from steel plate. Our primary differentiators within our industry lay with our universally compatible tooling, software and production processes, which provide critical redundancy for short lead-time items and within the multi-platform skills of our staff, who are qualified on our six press brakes and four plate rolling machines. \n\nWith overhead cranage and controllable access, our Bayswater forming workshop is designed to enable the rapid, safe and secure processing of multiple streams of steel material. Every piece of tooling and every machine setup can be applied to every one of our press brakes - enabling true optimisation of our production schedule based on our clients needs.\n\nIn essence, we provide critical redundancy in tools and talent to ensure that your project is completed on time and\
  \ to the highest standards. When something goes wrong, the job still gets done, a rare capability in industrial manufacturing."
