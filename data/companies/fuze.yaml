overview: 'The FUZE team provides urgent response to ensure the continued operation of critical assets by combining the latest composite technology with structural engineering to replace steel with advanced composites. These solutions are class approved and are delivered without requiring hot works, heavy lifting or large personnel foot-print. This allows assets to increase availability and in many cases not require removing from operating conditions to implement a repair or strengthening scope.


  FUZE is a composite systems manufacturer with integrated technology, engineering project services and field teams allowing rapid delivery of large, high risk projects successfully and provide warranty support for the life of the composite component.'

capabilities: 'FUZE can repair ships at sea or along side rather than dry-docking for large crop and renew scopes.  FUZE has provided flay-away teams for the RNZN and RAN to complete urgent defect scopes on surface ships.


  These services can be used to rapidly repair pipework, pipelines, large storage tanks, jetties, marine infrastructure and underwater applications as the materials can be applied underwater using divers.'
