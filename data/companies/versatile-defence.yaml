overview: 'Versatile Defence is an Australian-owned company built on a strong foundation of maritime and industrial expertise through its sister brand, Versatile Marine. Drawing on years of experience in delivering high-performance solutions for commercial and government vessels, Versatile Defence was established to expand this capability into the defence sector—providing innovative, practical, and mission-ready systems for Australia’s evolving strategic landscape.


  Our involvement in the defence industry is driven by a commitment to supporting sovereign capability through three core pillars: consulting, trade, and manufacturing. We partner with global defence suppliers to introduce proven technologies to Australia while offering tailored consulting services that bridge the gap between operational requirements and product integration. Complementing this, our in-house development of rugged poly boats showcases our hands-on engineering capability, delivering durable, low-maintenance platforms ideal for patrol, training, and support operations.


  Versatile Defence operates with agility and a collaborative approach, ensuring that every project—whether it involves vessel design, system supply, or operational consulting—is aligned with the needs of defence, security, and law enforcement agencies. By combining international partnerships with Australian ingenuity, we aim to enhance readiness, safety, and sustainability across the maritime defence domain.


  With a focus on practical innovation and long-term reliability, Versatile Defence continues to build trusted relationships with defence clients and industry partners, contributing to Australia’s maritime strength and resilience.'

capabilities: 'Versatile Defence offers a comprehensive suite of capabilities tailored to the defence, security, and maritime sectors. Our core strengths lie in **specialist consulting** , **supply of advanced defence technologies** , and **manufacture of high-performance poly boats** —each designed to enhance operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability.


  Through our consulting arm, we provide expert guidance across vessel systems, engineering integration, and operational support. Our team’s background in commercial and government maritime projects enables us to deliver pragmatic solutions aligned with defence standards and compliance frameworks. We have supported defence-related clients by advising on vessel lighting upgrades, propulsion efficiency, and emissions compliance using technologies sourced from our international partners.


  Our trade and distribution capability connects the Australian defence sector with world-class equipment and systems. Through strategic partnerships, we deliver reliable, field-proven technologies that enhance vessel performance and reduce environmental impact. These systems have been deployed in government and paramilitary fleets, improving safety, efficiency, and crew comfort.


  Versatile Defence’s in-house **poly boat manufacturing** capability represents a unique offering within Australia. Our rugged, low-maintenance vessels are engineered for demanding operational environments and suited for patrol, training, and transport applications. With our recent access to newer technology, we are now able to 3D print these vessels for fast prototyping needs.


  By combining global innovation with Australian production and service capability, Versatile Defence provides practical, cost-effective solutions that support sovereign readiness, reduce maintenance overheads, and extend operational life across defence assets.'
