overview: "OLEOLOGY's expertise in water treatment systems includes advanced solutions to recycle and decontaminate water quicker, simpler, and more cost-effective.  \n  \nIncorporating the MyCelx technology, which efficiently removes organics, oils, hydrocarbons, Mercury and PFAS to below detectable levels, OLEOLOGY's solution is a small footprint solution that is designed to remove free oil, dispersed and emulsified hydrocarbons to the environment, well below EPA requirements.  \n  \nWhile other oil-water separators rely on mechanical separation or chemicals, MyCelx bonds with oil and other contaminants at a molecular level. This means oils, hydrocarbons, and other contaminants are removed almost completely without any water loss.   \n  \nSome of MyCelx's many benefits are:  \n• Oil Contaminant levels reduced to less than 1ppm.  \n• No release back into the water  \n• Designed to any flow rate and discharge requirements.  \n• Easy to install, operate and maintain.  \n• Low power requirements.\
  \  \n• Small Footprint, Low-pressure drop, High Throughput.  \n• Skid mount or Containerized.  \n• Environmentally Green Engineered Oily Water Filtration and Hydrocarbon Odour Removal.  \n• The only technology certified by Lloyd's Register for oily water treatment and discharge into marine environments.  \n• Economical - Lowest capital and competitive operating costs."
