capabilities: "Fortuna CFO Services aren't your typical accountants. Our primary focus is on making you pay MORE tax. By improving your profitability, working with you to strengthen your balance sheet and improve your cash flow, we will help you to ensure that you are set up for success in your chosen field.  \n  \nWe were born out of a sense of frustration at seeing so many small businesses fail when our intervention could have helped them be successful. SMEs don't generally have the resources to pay upwards of $250k for a full time, experienced senior finance professional, but having a resource available that can not only work with you on a part time basis, at a fraction of the cost, but also knows what it is like to work at the sharp end and has an affinity with people in the military."
