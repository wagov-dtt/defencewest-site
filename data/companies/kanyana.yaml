With a rich history spanning over 25 years, we have successfully catered to various sectors, including commercial, industrial, mining, and defence. Kanyana''s cutting-edge fiber laser cutting technology, enabling us to achieve remarkable tolerances of 0.03mm cutting sheet sizes 6000mm x 2500mm. This expanded cutting capability has propelled us into the realms of aerospace and shipbuilding manufacturing, where precision components and accuracy are of utmost importance.


  We have already established a strong presence with Primes by supplying a range of critical parts. Our contributions to the Defence Industry (DI) include manufacturing rocket launcher trolleys, military drone fuel tanks, door brackets, and mountings for flags on ships. Moreover, our close collaboration with several DI contractors has resulted in successful partnerships. For Austal projects, we have assisted in ship kitchen fit-outs, storage lockers, and bracketry, providing overflow works for naval assets along with the production of maritime bracketry and legacy parts. At HMAS Stirling, we have supplied rocket launcher trolleys and fabricated stainless-steel drainage down-pipes on the naval base. Additionally, we have worked with Innovaero to supply drone aluminium parts and large aircraft floor structures.
