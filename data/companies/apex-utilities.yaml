name: APEX Utilities Pty Ltd
slug: apex-utilities
overview: 'Apex Utilities is a Western Australian–owned utilities and civil contractor delivering specialist trenchless and open-cut infrastructure works across metropolitan and regional Western Australia. While Apex Utilities is an emerging participant in the defence industry, the company brings strong, directly transferable capability developed through the delivery of complex, safety-critical works within regulated environments.


  The business has established a reputation for high-quality delivery in underground utilities installation, including horizontal directional drilling (HDD), trenching, reinstatement and safe excavation for water, gas, power and communications infrastructure. These works require rigorous planning, asset protection, risk management and strict compliance with client specifications and statutory requirements — capabilities that align closely with Defence project expectations.


  Apex Utilities operates a predominantly in-house delivery model, supported by a skilled WA-based workforce and an apprenticeship-led development framework. This approach ensures consistent standards, strong supervision and reliable performance outcomes, particularly on complex or high-risk projects. The company is recognised for strike-free delivery and a strong safety culture embedded across all levels of the organisation.


  As part of its commitment to continuous improvement and readiness for Defence engagement, Apex Utilities is implementing an integrated management system aligned to ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environmental) and ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety). The business is also an active member of the Civil Contractors Federation (CCF), supporting industry best practice and workforce development.


  Apex Utilities is committed to supporting Defence objectives through reliable delivery, workforce capability, local industry participation and the provision of compliant, high-quality civil and utilities services.'
