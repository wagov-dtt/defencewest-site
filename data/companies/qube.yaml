capabilities: "Qube Bulk capabilities include mine, road, rail, storage, port and ship services. Qube Bulk handles various bulk ores, concentrates, mineral sands, salt, coal and dangerous goods. We own and operate strategic infrastructure throughout the supply chain. Qube Bulk is independent, experienced and actively investing in bulk export chain projects. This combination provides customers with a low risk solution. Independence is particularly useful in open access facilities where there are multiple users. Where possible, we look to invest in bulk material handling systems and port facilities.   \nOur customers benefit directly from our extensive experience in project development, supply chain management, port operations, and the design, development and operation of infrastructure. We work with exporters, rail operators and port owners, and we understand the complex interaction between the various stakeholders. With substantial experience in the operation of largescale, bulk export facilities\
  \ and bulk material supply chains, we offer significant value."
