capabilities: 'Constructive Media is a multi-disciplined company based in Western Australia, specialising in producting 3D renders/images and animations to help depict processes, infrastructure, build phases, products and services. Our work is often found in Government presentations, and when suppliers and contractors are proposing new and improved products and services to the Defence Industry. Our ability to help our clients to communicate really helps to unlock concepts and ideas, bringing to light the advantages of a new proposal.


  Our ability to code interactive software (websites, standalone applications) also extends to API coding, so we can “bridge the gap” between various pieces of software. And where data visualisation is required, we have the skillset to be able to depict key data in an easy to digest format. We work with a vast range of digital file formats, and our genuine interest and intrigue for solving problems keeps our minds sharp and options open.'
discriminators: 'We have carefully honed our craft since opening in 2003, and our ability work across a wide range of industries gives us the advantage of being able to relate and understand complex technical drawings, or what to look for when promoting new infrastructure. Our work is done here in Western Australia, and we like to support local businesses and charities.


  We have developed in-house processes to assist with production, and our quality is constantly being recognised as being cutting edge and innovative.'
