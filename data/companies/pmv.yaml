overview: 'PMV Engineering is an Indigenous-owned company with over 25 years of operational experience through its origins as a nationally recognised training provider in post-trade electrical. Our growth into engineering services was driven by industry demand for practical, safety-focused solutions, particularly in electrical hazardous areas, instrumentation, and asset management.


  We have supported clients across Australia in high-risk and complex environments, including power generation, water infrastructure, mining, and oil and gas. This experience has laid a strong foundation for expanding our capabilities into the defence sector. Our team brings together more than 300 years of combined industry experience and is trusted for delivering reliable, compliant solutions that meet stringent safety and operational standards.


  Our engagement in the defence industry is built on our proven capability in classified environments, including supporting prime contractors and facilities with hazardous area compliance, inspection services, and engineering support. We understand the importance of working within secure, controlled, and mission-critical settings and pride ourselves on our ability to deliver to specification and schedule.


  With operations in WA, SA, and NT, and a strong focus on Indigenous engagement and workforce development, PMV is committed to supporting Australia''s sovereign capability goals through sustainable and skilled service delivery. We look forward to contributing to the defence industry with a focus on integrity, safety, and long-term value.'

capabilities: 'PMV Engineering delivers practical, safety-driven solutions in hazardous areas, electrical instrumentation, and asset management -- key capability areas for defence operations. Our services include EEHA compliance audits, hazardous area classification, remediation, verification dossiers, Fitness for Purpose reporting, and labour supply of licensed hazardous area technicians.


  We have experience operating in high-risk, regulated environments across WA, SA, and NT, including secure and government-controlled facilities. Our team is trusted for its ability to deliver quality outcomes while meeting strict safety, compliance, and confidentiality standards.


  PMV recently provided hazardous area inspections, technical reporting, and remediation support for Water Corporation sites across regional Western Australia. These projects required adherence to government frameworks, risk mitigation protocols, and detailed asset documentation -- all directly aligned with the standards expected in the defence sector.


  Our background in utilities, oil and gas, and critical infrastructure has positioned us well to service defence clients requiring reliability, compliance, and responsiveness. We are also supporting Indigenous procurement objectives through our Indigenous ownership, local presence, and experienced personnel.


  With a team holding over 300 years of combined experience, PMV offers capability, capacity, and commitment to supporting Australia''s defence goals.'
