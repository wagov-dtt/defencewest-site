capabilities: 'Our objective is to replace imported fossil fuels with sustainable, renewable and 100% compatible biofuels. All our biofuels will be ''drop in'', ie 100% compatible with current fossil fuel diesel and aviation fuel.


  We are planning to have both centralised large scale operations and remote small scale fuel production facilities.


  Our feedstock to produce renewable fuels is primarily agricultural and forestry residues. In principle, any sustainable organic feedstock can be utilised.'
discriminators: "* Locally produced sustainable biofuels\n  * Currently producing A$10m revenue, planning to scale up\n  * All feedstock sustainably sourced\n  * Biofuels as a renewable creates employment primarily in regional Australia"
