capabilities: 'Our Silicon Data Vault - High Assurance (SDV-HA) product is the only secure portable storage device certified by the ASD to store Top Secret data, yet it can also be handled as an Unclassified device when not powered on. Highly-sensitive data can therefore be transported by personnel without the need for a safe-hand courier. Unique features of the SDV-HA include: a tamper detection and response sub-system that continuously monitors and cryptographically deletes all data upon detecting a tamper event; strong encryption of all stored data; strong 2-factor authentication; two modes of operation; and small form factor to enable portability.'
