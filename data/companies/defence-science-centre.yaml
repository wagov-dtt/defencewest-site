overview: The Defence Science Centre exists to transform defence science challenges into tangible capabilities for both Defence and local industry with the goal of developing a strong Western Australian defence research ecosystem. It does this by facilitating bespoke connections between academia, industry and Defence, and providing grants that create pathways for these connections and defence-relevant research. The Defence Science Centre identifies and promotes national and international opportunities for Western Australia’s academic and small-to-medium enterprise community, to support the State’s science and innovation capabilities. The Defence Science Centre also works more broadly with other Defence Science Technology Group-affiliated organisations across Australia, to better meet the needs of Defence, and foster national defence science connections. The Defence Science Centre exists as part of Defence West within the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation, and is an initiative
  of the WA Defence and Defence Industries Strategic Plan.
