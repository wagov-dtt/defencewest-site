slug: trident
overview: 'Trident Australia, established in 1998 and based in Perth, Western Australia, and Victoria, provides engineered solutions for critical fluid and pneumatic systems. With over 27 years of industry experience, we deliver end-to-end conceptual design, reverse engineering, manufacturing, assembly, and testing services for demanding and safety-critical environments.


  Our core capabilities include the design and manufacture of custom pneumatic and fluid systems, hose assemblies, precision fabrication, and NATA-accredited calibration services. These capabilities are supported by a skilled in-house engineering team, advanced workshop facilities, and established ISO-certified quality management systems.


  While Trident has a strong history supporting the oil & gas, subsea, mining, and industrial sectors, we have recently commenced our formal journey into the defence industry. Despite being new to the sector, we have already secured Defence purchase orders for hose integrity management and calibration services—demonstrating confidence in our technical capability, traceability, and compliance with Defence standards and expectations.


  Trident is committed to supporting Australia’s sovereign defence capability by strengthening local supply chains, investing in relevant defence certifications, and aligning our processes and documentation with industry requirements. Our local design and manufacturing capability enables rapid response, quality assurance, and reduced reliance on imported systems—supporting operational readiness and through-life sustainment.


  As we continue to expand our defence footprint, Trident remains focused on building trusted, long-term partnerships with Defence Primes, SMEs, and end users. Through collaboration, innovation, and quality-driven outcomes, we aim to contribute meaningfully to Australia’s defence industrial base and the success of future programs under AUKUS and beyond.'
