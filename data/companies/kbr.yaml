overview: 'KBR (Kellogg Brown & Root) has a long-standing history in defence, evolving from early 20th-century engineering roots into a global leader in government services. Today, KBR delivers advanced solutions across defence, aerospace, and intelligence sectors.


  Globally, KBR has supported major U.S. military operations and continues to provide mission-critical services across all domains. In the UK, KBR is a strategic supplier to the Ministry of Defence, delivering infrastructure, logistics, and digital transformation. Through Aspire Defence, it manages accommodation for 30% of the British Army, and via KBS Maritime (a joint venture with BAE Systems), it provides infrastructure services at HMNB Portsmouth under the Future Maritime Support Programme. KBR also supports submarine programs such as Astute and Dreadnought and contributes to Defence AI and space domain awareness through its subsidiary Frazer-Nash.


  In Australia, KBR supports major maritime programs including Capability Life Cycle Management for the Amphibious Combat and Sealift fleet. It is a leading provider of Defence training services, preparing personnel for new systems and platforms using 3D modelling, simulation, and virtual environments.


  KBR plays a pivotal role in national defence infrastructure. At HMAS Stirling in Western Australia, it has delivered design services under the Navy Capability Infrastructure Subprogram (NCIS) and Defence Fuels Transformation Program (DFTP). It also supports the Submarine Rotational Force – West (SRF-W), contributing to sovereign capability for nuclear-powered submarines. In South Australia, KBR is a design partner for the Nuclear-Powered Submarine Construction Yard (NPSCY) at Osborne, designing facilities essential to the SSN-AUKUS program. These projects reflect KBR’s integration of nuclear safety, maritime infrastructure, and systems engineering expertise.'
