capabilities: For over 15 years, we have developed and maintained a strong relationship with the Australian Defence Force (ADF) through our position as a trusted partner in support of the Navy’s Collins-class submarines. Local activities comprise combat system design, development, integration and test as well as complex project management, integrated logistics support and technical governance. Following on from our involvement in the successful Combat System Augmentation program, we were selected for the Collins Replacement Combat System (RCS) program, and tasked with designing and delivering the combat systems hardware necessary to accommodate the US Navy’s AN/BYG-1 Tactical Weapon Control System. In this role, Raytheon Australia became responsible for the enterprise architecture, systems hardware and software engineering necessary for the design, development, test and delivery of the interface between the AN/BYG-1 system and a range of legacy and new sensors on the Collins platform. In
  addition to the Henderson site, we maintain a dedicated Collins workforce at HMAS Stirling, Outer Harbour (South Australia), Canberra and Sydney. By establishing these co-located operations with our naval customer, we have maximised collaboration efforts across multiple areas of the enterprise.
