overview: Ghost Fire Systems is a veteran owned and operated research and development company, focused on developing battlefield simulators. Ghost Fire Systems simulators integrate with in-service weapons and replicate them being fired, using electronics as a substitution for blank firing cartridges or explosive munitions. The simulators enable soldiers to train more often, enhancing their neural pathways, allowing them to process more information on the battlefield to improve their decision making and thus survivability.
